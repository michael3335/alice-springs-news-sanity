We&#8217;ve got the elderly people in this town, nursing homes have been broken into twice this week. Elderly people are being broken into in the suburbs here, being bashed. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We can&#8217;t drive from one side of town to the other of a night. We are in a self-imposed curfew in Alice Springs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This town now for four years has been allowed to go to wrack and ruin. I&#8217;ve fought for three, four years for this, to save this town and nothing&#8217;s been done, it&#8217;s just escalated and escalated. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We&#8217;ve lost a life here. We&#8217;ve lost a life in Darwin and I&#8217;m telling you now, we will lose more lives and we can&#8217;t have that. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">So someone&#8217;s going to have blood on their hands very shortly. So someone needs to take control of this. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I would like Peter to go back to Canberra with Jacinta, bipartisanship, to sit down with the Prime Minister and Linda Burney because this needs sorting out. We can&#8217;t wait any longer. We can&#8217;t wait for generational change. We&#8217;ve got kids hurting. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We&#8217;ve got women being bashed. We&#8217;ve got men with severe alcohol problems. They&#8217;ve been forgotten too. We&#8217;ve got to change. We&#8217;ve got to change this immediately. We’ve got to save lives because people can&#8217;t wait any longer.  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">So I&#8217;d like to really thank Peter for coming up. I&#8217;d like him to go away and use the experience here. It&#8217;s wonderful and I&#8217;m very thankful that he’s actually walking the streets. He walked the streets today. That&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve got to do as a Leader. You&#8217;ve got to walk the streets and you&#8217;ve got to talk to the people and you&#8217;ve got to hear the truth. I try and put the truth out there, no one wants to listen.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">So mate, I thank you very much for coming up. I know the people of Alice will. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>PRICE: </b>Thanks Darren. I&#8217;m really pleased that we have our Opposition Leader Peter Dutton here today in my home town of Alice Springs. He&#8217;s learnt a lot. We’ve learnt a lot – well I know what&#8217;s been going on the ground within my own home community. The fact that as a local resident myself, I&#8217;m very concerned about going out late at night. One of my sons works at the cinema. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It&#8217;s scary to think that to try and pick him up at the end of his shift, you know, you&#8217;ve got to keep an eye out for any potential, you know, a stolen car coming through a red light, you&#8217;re checking both ways, you&#8217;re making sure that you feel safe, that you know, you want your own children to be safe. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">My sons, you know, some of them are now in their early 20s and to be concerned for their welfare even late at night is huge in the home town that I grew up in and the amount of children that are on our streets. We&#8217;ve been calling now for the Territory government, certainly for the Federal government to do more to actually create some effective change around the safety of Indigenous children who are on the streets, who are left in dysfunctional circumstances. They&#8217;re on our streets because a lot of those kids have been in the foster care system, have been under the responsibility of Territory families, and through that, their human rights haven&#8217;t been upheld, they&#8217;ve been left in dysfunctional circumstances, or removed from healthy foster families and put back into dysfunction because apparently it&#8217;s their culture that&#8217;s more important to them, than their actual human rights. <b> </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">These children need to be protected from a young age. We did meet a woman today who has a foster child in her care, who she fought the system so that child would not be removed from her care and that child is now thriving. That&#8217;s all we want for the children that we are seeing on our streets.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">There needs to be investment in alcohol and drug rehabilitation. Police need to be able to have the power to deal with the circumstances that they’re confronted with. We hear from Darren all the time, Darren&#8217;s Facebook page, we&#8217;re seeing what&#8217;s going on on the streets that we locals know what is happening.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Peter is here for another visit because apparently the last time when he went back to Albanese to suggest what needs to happen in this town, nothing’s happened as a result. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I&#8217;ve been fighting for Yipirinya School to be funded so that they can build their accommodation for staff and students, which is actually about putting those kids that are running around on our streets at night, who are in vulnerable homes, they&#8217;re from the town camps, putting them in accommodation that&#8217;s education focussed with adults that actually do care for their wellbeing. This is long overdue. This was a commitment that we had made as a Coalition going to the last Federal election.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This government, the Albanese Government can spend millions of dollars on what they claim is going to solve all these issues while the issues continue on. Millions of dollars and yet they cannot put $8.3 million into a school which takes care of vulnerable Indigenous kids in my hometown. It&#8217;s simple. Invest the money where it&#8217;s going to work. Don&#8217;t drag it out. Don&#8217;t pretend like you have the answer to everything, but we require a bloody Referendum for that answer to appear. That&#8217;s not the solution.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Locals know what the solutions are. I&#8217;ve listened to them. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Darren&#8217;s one of these locals. Peter&#8217;s been listening. It&#8217;s time for the Albanese Government</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> to step up and to listen. It&#8217;s time for the Fyles Government to actually step up and listen.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>DUTTON:</b> Jacinta, thank you. I want to start by saying thank you very much to Darren, who&#8217;s been the face of the community here and you can hear the pain in his<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>voice. Alice Springs is a beautiful town. It&#8217;s the heart of our country and that heart is broken at the moment. It&#8217;s clear that Alice Springs has never been further from Canberra than it is right now.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I would just say to the Prime Minister in a bipartisan way, just at a human level, please hear Darren&#8217;s story. There&#8217;s not another bakery in Australia that I&#8217;m aware of that has concrete bollards out the front and the shop next door here with six foot high iron bars to stop people from getting in and committing break and enters, wilful damage, theft, sexual assault. I mean this is commonplace in Alice Springs, in our country and it&#8217;s completely unacceptable and Australians should be as angry as anyone is who lives in this town.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">There are stories that we&#8217;ve heard today as we&#8217;ve walked the streets about the dysfunction, the desperation of young Indigenous kids who are being sexually assaulted still on a regular basis – that hasn&#8217;t stopped.  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">When I left here in October, I went to see the Prime Minister to plead with him to intervene, to do something, to not just say that they&#8217;re existing programs and the programs are rolling out and that they&#8217;re working with the Territory government. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">What&#8217;s here at the moment isn&#8217;t working. People are leaving this town in droves. I was just talking to a young lady, she and her husband have decided to pack up and leave a community that she loves, that she wants to stay in, but they just don&#8217;t believe that they&#8217;re safe here anymore and that is heartbreaking.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The Prime Minister needs to spend more time than just jumping off the jet, spending an hour or two here and then jumping on the jet and going back to Canberra. It&#8217;s not sufficient. It&#8217;s not good enough. I think the people of the Northern Territory, but in particular here in Alice Springs, deserve to be heard by their Prime Minister and he&#8217;s not listening, he&#8217;s not acting and the travesty will continue here in Alice Springs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Nothing has changed from when I was here in October. The same stories about break ins, about stolen cars, about risk to human life, about the sexual assault of young boys and girls. It&#8217;s still exactly as it was then, and this community can&#8217;t wait.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Regardless of your view on the Voice, we need to see help and assistance on the ground here to restore law and order and to make sure that people can go about their lives, can go to a barbecue without being accosted on the way to it or on the way home. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">That they can go to a restaurant at night, that they can do that safely. And people that we spoke to on the street today spoke about exactly that issue. Exactly that issue. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">And they&#8217;re just staying at home and so the economic productivity is lost in this community as well. Tourism numbers are down in Alice Springs because people won&#8217;t go and stay at the caravan park.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Let&#8217;s have an honest conversation in our country about the reality of what is happening here. Canberra is a million miles away and I&#8217;d say to the Prime Minister, to Linda Burney, to any of the government Ministers, come here, roll up your sleeves and listen to what people are saying here on the streets, because it is alarming and it&#8217;s very concerning.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>QUESTION: </b>What do you think the answer is? What can we do to change these alarming statistics of crime here. I mean the Federal government said they&#8217;ve put in $250 million. Where is that?  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>DUTTON: </b>But where? I mean where is that money? I understand that they&#8217;re still in a committee process of where that money will be spent. Now, a bidding war by public servants for more bureaucrats sitting in Canberra or Darwin is not going to fix the problem in Alice Springs. You need to restore law and order. In my conversation with the Prime Minister in October, I said to him, &#8216;look, mate, it&#8217;s beyond the resources.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> I don&#8217;t care whether it&#8217;s a CLP or a Labor government in the Northern Territory, it&#8217;s beyond their capacity to deal with this problem and it needs federal resources&#8217;. The Australian Federal Police should be supplementing the support that they can offer to the local police. There needs to be a greater presence on the ground.  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Kids and adults need to understand that there is a consequence for their actions. If you&#8217;re going to ram-raid a business or if you&#8217;re going to steal a car, there needs to be a very clear message to the next kid that&#8217;s thinking about doing that, that there&#8217;s a consequence, that there&#8217;s a price that you pay for it. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you&#8217;re told that you can do that without any punishment or next to no punishment, why wouldn’t your mates be out doing it the next night? Why wouldn&#8217;t they be on TikTok showing the video?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We need practical solutions here on the ground. Restoration of law and order is incredibly important. We need to have an understanding of what it means to take kids who we know are being sexually abused and put back into the hands of the abuser. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">There is nothing in the Indigenous culture that makes that acceptable. It&#8217;s an affront to the Indigenous culture as it is to any culture in a civilised country like ours. I can tell you now if there was a young boy or girl who had been sexually assaulted in Sydney or Melbourne or Brisbane or Canberra, and the police were putting that little white boy or girl back into the hands of the abuser, it would be the front page of every newspaper until the commissioner of that state or territory said that it was not going to happen. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Yet here, somehow it&#8217;s accepted as normal practice and we&#8217;re destroying the lives of those young Indigenous kids and it&#8217;s unacceptable and the Prime Minister needs to take responsibility. He was made aware of it last year and as Darren rightly points out – and he&#8217;s had the guts to stand up for his community at great personal cost to himself and his family – how can those little children continue to be abused? How in our country can we allow that to be commonplace? </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It&#8217;s unacceptable, and I think you get a sense when you walk the streets, when you do it particularly of a night time – when we were here last time we went out to the communities, we went out to the town camps – we&#8217;ve been speaking to businesses and locals here today and we need to make sure that we can listen to the locals, Indigenous, non-Indigenous and get the work underway to make sure that these people can lead a life that we would expect to lead in a capital city.  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>QUESTION: </b>So who will you be speaking to? Which organisations and which locals on the ground are you talking to? And are you going to be consulting with them about the Voice while you&#8217;re down here as well?  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>DUTTON: </b>Well, the short answer is yes, we will be consulting with people about the Voice, but the urgency of what&#8217;s happening here now needs to be understood. Some of the video that we saw before of kids hooning around, of knives, it needs to be addressed now.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Even if the Voice vote takes place in October, the Prime Minister is proposing six months of consultation after the vote takes place – so out to middle of next year before they&#8217;ll even have a design of what the Voice looks like – the action needs to be now. The assistance needs to be in this community tomorrow to stop that.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We&#8217;ve spoken to small businesses, we will meet with more of them. We&#8217;re speaking with the Mayor, who&#8217;s obviously got a broader perspective on the town.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We&#8217;ve spoken with a number of locals just on the street earlier, and we&#8217;ll continue that engagement because if you aren&#8217;t out there and you aren&#8217;t listening to what people are saying, then it&#8217;s very hard to find the solutions. The solutions aren&#8217;t going to be given to you by bureaucrats in Canberra. I can promise the Prime Minister that. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you&#8217;re listening to the bureaucrats who are just saying spend the $250 million on more bureaucrats, that&#8217;s going to make the situation worse. Where is the $250 million being pent? In what programs? And if it is being spent, why isn&#8217;t it having a positive impact on the community here?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>QUESTION:</b> Just for my colleagues in Canberra – how can you justify the Party&#8217;s position on the Voice when your two most recent Indigenous Affairs Minister, not just disagree with you, but quit in protest?  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>PETER DUTTON: </b>Well I mean you listen to the voice of Jacinta Price, you listen to the voice of Kerrynne Liddle, you listen to many Indigenous people that we&#8217;ve spoken to in this community, including back in October. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">When you speak to the Indigenous leaders in Laverton and Leonora, the Indigenous people I spoke to on Palm Island, up in East Arnhem Land, here in Alice Springs obviously, I&#8217;ve been to Darwin, there are plenty of Indigenous people in this country who are completely opposed to the Voice because they don&#8217;t believe that a Canberra voice is going to provide support to the local community here in Alice Springs, in Tennant Creek in Katherine and elsewhere.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">QUESTION: We spoke to Lhere Artepe CEO this morning. Lhere Artepe is the organisation that represents Traditional Owners in the town. He said he&#8217;s in support of it and he said that you didn&#8217;t consult with him about the Voice when you last visited. The Central Land Council over here has come out advocating for the Voice. Why aren&#8217;t you listening to those organisations?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>DUTTON:</b> Well, I&#8217;ll let those organisation speak for themselves. I&#8217;ve been out speaking to people on the ground; shoppers in shopping centres, people who are having their businesses boarded up, people who are actually living in the community and aren&#8217;t afraid to speak out. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The fortitude that Darren has shown is quite remarkable and it needs to be spoken about and it&#8217;s right that people see the confronting footage because without it, the Prime Minister wouldn&#8217;t have come up here even for a couple of hours. It&#8217;s okay to spend more time at the tennis than it is on the ground here in Alice Springs, but you need to listen to people in the local community and that&#8217;s exactly what we&#8217;ve done and it&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll continue to do.  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I don&#8217;t believe that a Canberra voice of 24 people who predominantly come from capital cities is going to be the solution to the problems here on the ground, if I did, I&#8217;d embrace it straight away. But I believe very strongly that listening to local and regional voices, which is what the Liberal Party is doing, is an attempt to make sure that we unite our country.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The Prime Minister at the moment is putting forward a model which divides our country and he won&#8217;t explain any of the detail. He won&#8217;t look Northern Territorians in the eye and explain how it is that the Voice is going to provide solutions to these problems and I just don&#8217;t believe that it will.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>DAY TWO</b> of Mr Dutton’s visit was pretty well a re-run of Day One, except for these exchanges: </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b> </b> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>QUESTION: </b>You mention again today the so-called &#8216;rampant rates&#8217; of child sexual abuse in Central Australia. Now we&#8217;ve seen the SNAICC [Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care], which advocates for Indigenous children, come out and strongly reject your call for a Royal Commission into that. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">They&#8217;ve labelled it an uninformed approach. Why do you think those kind of peak bodies are rejecting those calls by you, and what evidence do you have that there is this so-called “rampant child sexual abuse” occurring in remote central Australia?<b>  </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>DUTTON: </b> I mean with respect, that&#8217;s such an ABC question. Do you live locally? Do you speak to people on the streets to hear what it is they&#8217;re saying to you? I mean do you believe&#8230;<b>  </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>QUESTION:</b> I live locally.<b> </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>DUTTON: </b>I&#8217;ve spoken to the police and the social workers, some of whom are out on stress leave at the moment because of the scenes that they&#8217;ve endured. They have kids taking them back into homes where they&#8217;ve been sexually assaulted and six year olds grabbing on to their legs, screaming not to be left there. So they&#8217;re the people who are on the frontline. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I don&#8217;t know what the academics are saying. I don&#8217;t know what the bureaucrats are saying. I can tell you though, what the human experience is on the front line and if the ABC and others don&#8217;t see fit to report that, then frankly, I think it reflects more on the ABC than it does on the locals here, and I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re doing your job if you&#8217;re denying the reality of the circumstances on the ground.<b>  </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>QUESTION: </b>I&#8217;m not denying the reality. I&#8217;m asking you, what data are you using to support your claims here?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>DUTTON:</b> I&#8217;ve answered that question., so if there&#8217;s a more sensible one, I&#8217;d be happy to take it. <b> </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>PRICE: </b>Sorry, can I just say that I think the questions need to be put back on organisations like SNAICC, who are tasked to uphold the human rights of Indigenous children, but instead run an ideological line that it&#8217;s more important that these children are supposed to be connected to country and to culture than to actually have their human rights upheld.</span></p>\n",

We are seriously in trouble in this town. We&#8217;ve got young kids in trouble. No one cares for them. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Our Territory government doesn&#8217;t care for them. Our Federal government isn&#8217;t caring for them. We&#8217;ve got the elderly people in this town, nursing homes have been broken into twice this week. Elderly people are being broken into in the suburbs here, being bashed. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We can&#8217;t drive from one side of town to the other of a night. We are in a self-imposed curfew in Alice Springs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This town now for four years has been allowed to go to wrack and ruin. I&#8217;ve fought for three, four years for this, to save this town and nothing&#8217;s been done, it&#8217;s just escalated and escalated. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We&#8217;ve lost a life here. We&#8217;ve lost a life in Darwin and I&#8217;m telling you now, we will lose more lives and we can&#8217;t have that. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">So someone&#8217;s going to have blood on their hands very shortly. So someone needs to take control of this. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I would like Peter to go back to Canberra with Jacinta, bipartisanship, to sit down with the Prime Minister and Linda Burney because this needs sorting out. We can&#8217;t wait any longer. We can&#8217;t wait for generational change. We&#8217;ve got kids hurting. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We&#8217;ve got women being bashed. We&#8217;ve got men with severe alcohol problems. They&#8217;ve been forgotten too. We&#8217;ve got to change. We&#8217;ve got to change this immediately. We’ve got to save lives because people can&#8217;t wait any longer.  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">So I&#8217;d like to really thank Peter for coming up. I&#8217;d like him to go away and use the experience here. It&#8217;s wonderful and I&#8217;m very thankful that he’s actually walking the streets. He walked the streets today. That&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve got to do as a Leader. You&#8217;ve got to walk the streets and you&#8217;ve got to talk to the people and you&#8217;ve got to hear the truth. I try and put the truth out there, no one wants to listen.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">So mate, I thank you very much for coming up. I know the people of Alice will. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>PRICE: </b>Thanks Darren. I&#8217;m really pleased that we have our Opposition Leader Peter Dutton here today in my home town of Alice Springs. He&#8217;s learnt a lot. We’ve learnt a lot – well I know what&#8217;s been going on the ground within my own home community. The fact that as a local resident myself, I&#8217;m very concerned about going out late at night. One of my sons works at the cinema. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It&#8217;s scary to think that to try and pick him up at the end of his shift, you know, you&#8217;ve got to keep an eye out for any potential, you know, a stolen car coming through a red light, you&#8217;re checking both ways, you&#8217;re making sure that you feel safe, that you know, you want your own children to be safe. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">My sons, you know, some of them are now in their early 20s and to be concerned for their welfare even late at night is huge in the home town that I grew up in and the amount of children that are on our streets. We&#8217;ve been calling now for the Territory government, certainly for the Federal government to do more to actually create some effective change around the safety of Indigenous children who are on the streets, who are left in dysfunctional circumstances. They&#8217;re on our streets because a lot of those kids have been in the foster care system, have been under the responsibility of Territory families, and through that, their human rights haven&#8217;t been upheld, they&#8217;ve been left in dysfunctional circumstances, or removed from healthy foster families and put back into dysfunction because apparently it&#8217;s their culture that&#8217;s more important to them, than their actual human rights. <b> </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">These children need to be protected from a young age. We did meet a woman today who has a foster child in her care, who she fought the system so that child would not be removed from her care and that child is now thriving. That&#8217;s all we want for the children that we are seeing on our streets.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">There needs to be investment in alcohol and drug rehabilitation. Police need to be able to have the power to deal with the circumstances that they’re confronted with. We hear from Darren all the time, Darren&#8217;s Facebook page, we&#8217;re seeing what&#8217;s going on on the streets that we locals know what is happening.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Peter is here for another visit because apparently the last time when he went back to Albanese to suggest what needs to happen in this town, nothing’s happened as a result. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I&#8217;ve been fighting for Yipirinya School to be funded so that they can build their accommodation for staff and students, which is actually about putting those kids that are running around on our streets at night, who are in vulnerable homes, they&#8217;re from the town camps, putting them in accommodation that&#8217;s education focussed with adults that actually do care for their wellbeing. This is long overdue. This was a commitment that we had made as a Coalition going to the last Federal election.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This government, the Albanese Government can spend millions of dollars on what they claim is going to solve all these issues while the issues continue on. Millions of dollars and yet they cannot put $8.3 million into a school which takes care of vulnerable Indigenous kids in my hometown. It&#8217;s simple. Invest the money where it&#8217;s going to work. Don&#8217;t drag it out. Don&#8217;t pretend like you have the answer to everything, but we require a bloody Referendum for that answer to appear. That&#8217;s not the solution.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Locals know what the solutions are. I&#8217;ve listened to them. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Darren&#8217;s one of these locals. Peter&#8217;s been listening. It&#8217;s time for the Albanese Government</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> to step up and to listen. It&#8217;s time for the Fyles Government to actually step up and listen.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>DUTTON:</b> Jacinta, thank you. I want to start by saying thank you very much to Darren, who&#8217;s been the face of the community here and you can hear the pain in his<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>voice. Alice Springs is a beautiful town. It&#8217;s the heart of our country and that heart is broken at the moment. It&#8217;s clear that Alice Springs has never been further from Canberra than it is right now.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I would just say to the Prime Minister in a bipartisan way, just at a human level, please hear Darren&#8217;s story. There&#8217;s not another bakery in Australia that I&#8217;m aware of that has concrete bollards out the front and the shop next door here with six foot high iron bars to stop people from getting in and committing break and enters, wilful damage, theft, sexual assault. I mean this is commonplace in Alice Springs, in our country and it&#8217;s completely unacceptable and Australians should be as angry as anyone is who lives in this town.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">There are stories that we&#8217;ve heard today as we&#8217;ve walked the streets about the dysfunction, the desperation of young Indigenous kids who are being sexually assaulted still on a regular basis – that hasn&#8217;t stopped.  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">When I left here in October, I went to see the Prime Minister to plead with him to intervene, to do something, to not just say that they&#8217;re existing programs and the programs are rolling out and that they&#8217;re working with the Territory government. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">What&#8217;s here at the moment isn&#8217;t working. People are leaving this town in droves. I was just talking to a young lady, she and her husband have decided to pack up and leave a community that she loves, that she wants to stay in, but they just don&#8217;t believe that they&#8217;re safe here anymore and that is heartbreaking.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The Prime Minister needs to spend more time than just jumping off the jet, spending an hour or two here and then jumping on the jet and going back to Canberra. It&#8217;s not sufficient. It&#8217;s not good enough. I think the people of the Northern Territory, but in particular here in Alice Springs, deserve to be heard by their Prime Minister and he&#8217;s not listening, he&#8217;s not acting and the travesty will continue here in Alice Springs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Nothing has changed from when I was here in October. The same stories about break ins, about stolen cars, about risk to human life, about the sexual assault of young boys and girls. It&#8217;s still exactly as it was then, and this community can&#8217;t wait.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Regardless of your view on the Voice, we need to see help and assistance on the ground here to restore law and order and to make sure that people can go about their lives, can go to a barbeque without being accosted on the way to it or on the way home. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">That they can go to a restaurant at night, that they can do that safely. And people that we spoke to on the street today spoke about exactly that issue. Exactly that issue. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">And they&#8217;re just staying at home and so the economic productivity is lost in this community as well. Tourism numbers are down in Alice Springs because people won&#8217;t go and stay at the caravan park.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Let&#8217;s have an honest conversation in our country about the reality of what is happening here. Canberra is a million miles away and I&#8217;d say to the Prime Minister, to Linda Burney, to any of the government Ministers, come here, roll up your sleeves and listen to what people are saying here on the streets, because it is alarming and it&#8217;s very concerning.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>QUESTION: </b>What do you think the answer is? What can we do to change these alarming statistics of crime here. I mean the Federal government said they&#8217;ve put in $250 million. Where is that?  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>DUTTON: </b>But where? I mean where is that money? I understand that they&#8217;re still in a committee process of where that money will be spent. Now, a bidding war by public servants for more bureaucrats sitting in Canberra or Darwin is not going to fix the problem in Alice Springs. You need to restore law and order. In my conversation with the Prime Minister in October, I said to him, &#8216;look, mate, it&#8217;s beyond the resources.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> I don&#8217;t care whether it&#8217;s a CLP or a Labor government in the Northern Territory, it&#8217;s beyond their capacity to deal with this problem and it needs federal resources&#8217;. The Australian Federal Police should be supplementing the support that they can offer to the local police. There needs to be a greater presence on the ground.  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Kids and adults need to understand that there is a consequence for their actions. If you&#8217;re going to ram-raid a business or if you&#8217;re going to steal a car, there needs to be a very clear message to the next kid that&#8217;s thinking about doing that, that there&#8217;s a consequence, that there&#8217;s a price that you pay for it. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you&#8217;re told that you can do that without any punishment or next to no punishment, why wouldn’t your mates be out doing it the next night? Why wouldn&#8217;t they be on TikTok showing the video?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We need practical solutions here on the ground. Restoration of law and order is incredibly important. We need to have an understanding of what it means to take kids who we know are being sexually abused and put back into the hands of the abuser. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">There is nothing in the Indigenous culture that makes that acceptable. It&#8217;s an affront to the Indigenous culture as it is to any culture in a civilised country like ours. I can tell you now if there was a young boy or girl who had been sexually assaulted in Sydney or Melbourne or Brisbane or Canberra, and the police were putting that little white boy or girl back into the hands of the abuser, it would be the front page of every newspaper until the commissioner of that state or territory said that it was not going to happen. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Yet here, somehow it&#8217;s accepted as normal practice and we&#8217;re destroying the lives of those young Indigenous kids and it&#8217;s unacceptable and the Prime Minister needs to take responsibility. He was made aware of it last year and as Darren rightly points out – and he&#8217;s had the guts to stand up for his community at great personal cost to himself and his family – how can those little children continue to be abused? How in our country can we allow that to be commonplace? </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It&#8217;s unacceptable, and I think you get a sense when you walk the streets, when you do it particularly of a night time – when we were here last time we went out to the communities, we went out to the town camps – we&#8217;ve been speaking to businesses and locals here today and we need to make sure that we can listen to the locals, Indigenous, non-Indigenous and get the work underway to make sure that these people can lead a life that we would expect to lead in a capital city.  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>QUESTION: </b>So who will you be speaking to? Which organisations and which locals on the ground are you talking to? And are you going to be consulting with them about the Voice while you&#8217;re down here as well?  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>DUTTON: </b>Well, the short answer is yes, we will be consulting with people about the Voice, but the urgency of what&#8217;s happening here now needs to be understood. Some of the video that we saw before of kids hooning around, of knives, it needs to be addressed now.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Even if the Voice vote takes place in October, the Prime Minister is proposing six months of consultation after the vote takes place – so out to middle of next year before they&#8217;ll even have a design of what the Voice looks like – the action needs to be now. The assistance needs to be in this community tomorrow to stop that.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We&#8217;ve spoken to small businesses, we will meet with more of them. We&#8217;re speaking with the Mayor, who&#8217;s obviously got a broader perspective on the town.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We&#8217;ve spoken with a number of locals just on the street earlier, and we&#8217;ll continue that engagement because if you aren&#8217;t out there and you aren&#8217;t listening to what people are saying, then it&#8217;s very hard to find the solutions. The solutions aren&#8217;t going to be given to you by bureaucrats in Canberra. I can promise the Prime Minister that. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you&#8217;re listening to the bureaucrats who are just saying spend the $250 million on more bureaucrats, that&#8217;s going to make the situation worse. Where is the $250 million being pent? In what programs? And if it is being spent, why isn&#8217;t it having a positive impact on the community here?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>QUESTION:</b> Just for my colleagues in Canberra – how can you justify the Party&#8217;s position on the Voice when your two most recent Indigenous Affairs Minister, not just disagree with you, but quit in protest?  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>PETER DUTTON: </b>Well I mean you listen to the voice of Jacinta Price, you listen to the voice of Kerrynne Liddle, you listen to many Indigenous people that we&#8217;ve spoken to in this community, including back in October. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">When you speak to the Indigenous leaders in Laverton and Leonora, the Indigenous people I spoke to on Palm Island, up in East Arnhem Land, here in Alice Springs obviously, I&#8217;ve been to Darwin, there are plenty of Indigenous people in this country who are completely opposed to the Voice because they don&#8217;t believe that a Canberra voice is going to provide support to the local community here in Alice Springs, in Tennant Creek in Katherine and elsewhere.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">QUESTION: We spoke to Lhere Artepe CEO this morning. Lhere Artepe is the organisation that represents Traditional Owners in the town. He said he&#8217;s in support of it and he said that you didn&#8217;t consult with him about the Voice when you last visited. The Central Land Council over here has come out advocating for the Voice. Why aren&#8217;t you listening to those organisations?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>DUTTON:</b> Well, I&#8217;ll let those organisation speak for themselves. I&#8217;ve been out speaking to people on the ground; shoppers in shopping centres, people who are having their businesses boarded up, people who are actually living in the community and aren&#8217;t afraid to speak out. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The fortitude that Darren has shown is quite remarkable and it needs to be spoken about and it&#8217;s right that people see the confronting footage because without it, the Prime Minister wouldn&#8217;t have come up here even for a couple of hours. It&#8217;s okay to spend more time at the tennis than it is on the ground here in Alice Springs, but you need to listen to people in the local community and that&#8217;s exactly what we&#8217;ve done and it&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll continue to do.  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I don&#8217;t believe that a Canberra voice of 24 people who predominantly come from capital cities is going to be the solution to the problems here on the ground, if I did, I&#8217;d embrace it straight away. But I believe very strongly that listening to local and regional voices, which is what the Liberal Party is doing, is an attempt to make sure that we unite our country.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The Prime Minister at the moment is putting forward a model which divides our country and he won&#8217;t explain any of the detail. He won&#8217;t look Northern Territorians in the eye and explain how it is that the Voice is going to provide solutions to these problems and I just don&#8217;t believe that it will.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>DAY TWO</b> of Mr Dutton’s visit was pretty well a re-run of Day One, except for these exchanges: </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b> </b> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>QUESTION: </b>You mention again today the so-called &#8216;rampant rates&#8217; of child sexual abuse in Central Australia. Now we&#8217;ve seen the SNAICC [Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care], which advocates for Indigenous children, come out and strongly reject your call for a Royal Commission into that. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">They&#8217;ve labelled it an uninformed approach. Why do you think those kind of peak bodies are rejecting those calls by you, and what evidence do you have that there is this so-called “rampant child sexual abuse” occurring in remote central Australia?<b>  </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>DUTTON: </b> I mean with respect, that&#8217;s such an ABC question. Do you live locally? Do you speak to people on the streets to hear what it is they&#8217;re saying to you? I mean do you believe&#8230;<b>  </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>QUESTION:</b> I live locally.<b> </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>DUTTON: </b>I&#8217;ve spoken to the police and the social workers, some of whom are out on stress leave at the moment because of the scenes that they&#8217;ve endured. They have kids taking them back into homes where they&#8217;ve been sexually assaulted and six year olds grabbing on to their legs, screaming not to be left there. So they&#8217;re the people who are on the frontline. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I don&#8217;t know what the academics are saying. I don&#8217;t know what the bureaucrats are saying. I can tell you though, what the human experience is on the front line and if the ABC and others don&#8217;t see fit to report that, then frankly, I think it reflects more on the ABC than it does on the locals here, and I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re doing your job if you&#8217;re denying the reality of the circumstances on the ground.<b>  </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>QUESTION: </b>I&#8217;m not denying the reality. I&#8217;m asking you, what data are you using to support your claims here?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>DUTTON:</b> I&#8217;ve answered that question., so if there&#8217;s a more sensible one, I&#8217;d be happy to take it. <b> </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>PRICE: </b>Sorry, can I just say that I think the questions need to be put back on organisations like SNAICC, who are tasked to uphold the human rights of Indigenous children, but instead run an ideological line that it&#8217;s more important that these children are supposed to be connected to country and to culture than to actually have their human rights upheld.</span></p>\n",

He made everyone he met feel special and inspired. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">There were so many issues and involvements he had a hand in. He had a deep love of his family, his community, the Warlpiri Nation and people in general.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>His quiet manner conveyed authority and commanded deep respect. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">To the end he was unstoppable and put others before himself. He was in it for the long haul and never stopped fighting for Aboriginal rights and the Warlpiri nation. He was a peacemaker and ambassador.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>He was a statesman and a true warrior.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Jakamarra was born in 1944 at Mt Doreen station.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>He was the 11</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>th</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> of 12 children for Hitler Jupurrula.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Jupurrula had four wives, Nellie Napanangka was Jakamarra’s mother.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>The family moved to Yuendumu when Jakamarra was small so the children could go to school.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This began a long journey – there were huge changes in his lifetime.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">As a small child Jakamarra walked from Yuendumu to Alice Springs with his family, following his father who was taken in chains by police, walking behind camels.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Towards the end of his life Jakamarra was doing video meetings over the internet – even in hospital. He did all this with grace and humility. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">As a child he was friends with the Fleming family. Tom Fleming helped his education after school hours. Jakamarra said he developed his command of English from Father Fleming, as he called him. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He became close friends with Adrian Fleming &#8211; there are three generations of his offspring named Adrian. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> Jakamarra loved his family with great warmth.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Jakamarra married twice. He had three children with his first wife, Candy, and one with Lynette his second wife.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>There are five grandchildren and nine great grandchildren. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Over the years, when his brothers and sisters passed away, he helped grow up their kids.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>He was the patriarch of a very large family who loved him dearly. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> It was unusual to see Jakamarra alone. He was always surrounded by family and people drawn to his friendly way.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>He was actively engaged with family and, if he couldn’t give what they needed, he made sure the right people were able to assist.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>He encouraged and enjoyed them, and growled at them when needed. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He loved little kids. When he was sick his great grandchildren brought a sparkle to his eyes.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In his early years he was a mechanic and welded the gates at Four Mile stockyards, still standing.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Later he went to Darwin for teacher training and to Tranby Cooperative College in Sydney where he met Aboriginal people from all over Australia. Many of these contacts continued throughout his life. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Jakamarra taught in schools in Darwin, Amoonguna and Yuendumu.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>This was even before citizenship.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Education was important to him and he encouraged his family to become educated.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>He was an educator all his life, for Yapa and Kardiya.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>His house always had books, magazines and newspapers. Learning to read seemed to happen by itself in his family.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He was an interpreter who spoke eight languages.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>His skills were in demand, especially in his early years.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>He was able to greet and talk with people in their own language, a skill that impressed his grandchildren.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">As a teenager he was engaged in Warlpiri ceremonial activities with the senior men.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>During this time senior men asked him to use &#8220;whitefella&#8221; education to benefit Warlpiri people and culture. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He took this seriously and often felt the weight of this.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Jakamarra knew his country well, he knew his dreamings well, especially possum and kangaroo.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>The Jardiwarnpa ceremony was very important to him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>He learned how to sing the songs from the older Jakamarras.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">All his life he loved the ceremonies important to Warlpiri life.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>He was deeply committed to ceremony and culture. He led many ceremonies and was respected by those he guided.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He was a good hunter and taught younger family how to hunt and prepare kangaroo properly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>The young ones were nervous about not doing things properly and getting growled at. They sometimes waited till it was darker so Jakamarra couldn’t see clearly what they were doing.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Jakamarra was comfortable in both Yapa and Kardiya worlds.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>He had friendships in both worlds.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>He wanted his grandchildren to have the same confidence and ensured they had broad experiences and were good communicators. He was a supporter of bi-lingual education at Yuendumu.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">From early adulthood Jakamarra helped academics document the Warlpiri world.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This ranges from material he recorded with his father and other old men through to work with Warlpiri Media on song lines.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He had a beautiful speaking voice and narrated many film documentaries. Many publications at the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Institute in Canberra include material going right back to his youth.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He was a true leader and diplomat, skilled in conflict resolution. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">From the beginning of Land Rights, Jakamarra was involved.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Early on he went to rallies around Australia, and later regarding the Intervention.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He was involved in land claims in Central Australia.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>He worked with Nick Peterson negotiating with government and miners.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In the 1970s he was on the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>In the 1980s he went to the United Nations in Geneva, with an Aboriginal delegation.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>In the nineties he was a member of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Regional Council.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He was the first Aboriginal Justice of the Peace in the NT.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>He worked with the justice system for decades, supporting Warlpiri prisoners. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Jakamarra was involved in Yuendumu organisations including the Yuendumu Mining Company, Social Club Store, Old People’s Programme, Warlpiri Media, Men’s Museum and repatriation of artefacts. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He was a member of Yuendumu Community Council and served as President.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>His skills were called on by many outside people working with Yuendumu. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Jakamarra helped establish organisations such as Congress, Tangentyere, Aboriginal Legal Aid and Central Land Council. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He was a member of the Aboriginal Benefit Trust Account Advisory Committee for many years.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The list of boards and committees is endless.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He was forever travelling and his house in Yuendumu was first stop for many visitors.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>It seemed that people dropped in at any time. He would put his shirt on and respond to their needs.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">   </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He was skilled at troubleshooting and resolving conflict. He was a great listener and negotiator.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>He meant a lot to many people.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>He often gave people the benefit of the doubt. He was able to see the best in people and encourage their strengths.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">All of this was done without an office, desk, phone or vehicle.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And usually without pay.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">When he and Lynette lived in a humpy in south camp, there was a red filing cabinet and an old office chair where Jakamarra could be found at the end of the day reading a newspaper or magazine.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Jakamarra was not a total workaholic.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>He loved having a yarn and a laugh. He enjoyed to drink and gamble. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Sometimes he would win big at blackjack and cards. He could disappear very quickly with his winnings!</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Football was a passion for Jakamarra.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>He was a one-eyed Collingwood fan and talked with Collingwood to organise jumpers for Yuendumu Magpies.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>As a young man he played football.

His family are grateful to Purple House and Yuendumu’s Old People’s Programme who helped him to spend his final weeks in Yuendumu.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> The love of his family was plain to see during the months of his sickness. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">His wife, daughter, son in law, and grandsons deserve special thanks for their attention to his comfort. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">A testament to the life of this wonderful man is that ceremonial objects held in a southern museum were last week returned to Yuendumu after years of negotiations. Jakamarra would be happy to see the men continue with ceremonial life.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">We have to say farewell now.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">We are grateful for the rich life of this man. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">A ceremonial leader, a community leader, a family patriarch.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He had sharp intelligence, generosity, wisdom and great humour and worked tirelessly for Warlpiri people – and for all Aboriginal people. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">   </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">We need to continue the work that he committed his life to.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">We must make sure the younger generation continue his legacy, for the benefit of Warlpiri generations to come. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This is the challenge he has left us.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>His life gives us strength to continue and inspiration.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">We who loved him are left with huge holes in our lives and in our hearts. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">We are better people for having known Jakamarra. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This is a massive loss to his family – and for the nation as a whole. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> May he forever rest in peace.</span></p>",

The lack of leadership from this Chief Minister is seeing long-term Territory businesses shut their door and people leaving the Territory in droves because they’ve simply had enough.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Labor Government has weakened consequences for youths doing the wrong thing, like removing breach of bail conditions as an offence. Labor is putting offenders first and completely ignoring victims of crime.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Last week on Mix104.9, in a snub to concerned Territorians, the Chief Minister ruled out reversing his watered down bail laws. In fact, he described the Territory’s bail laws as ‘extremely strong’.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Michael Gunner is absolutely delusional if he considers removing breach of bail conditions as an offence to be anything but weakening bail laws.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Confronting the issue of escalating crime in Alice Springs should be a priority for this Chief Minister, and the Minister for Central Australian Economic Reconstruction Chansey Paech. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Business confidence is at an all-time low and it doesn’t take an economist to figure out you can’t develop a local economy with the current levels of crime and anti-social behaviour in our town.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the lead up to the August 2020 election, the CLP pledged stronger penalties to deter criminal activity and make our communities safer for law abiding citizens.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A new Country Liberal Party Government would use the first sittings of Parliament following the election to introduce a raft of amendments to the Bail Act to ensure that repeat offenders face the consequences of their action, including: reversing the changes made by the Gunner Government which removed breach of bail conditions as an offence and removed the presumption in favour of bail for repeat youth offenders.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The CLP is committed to addressing youth crime with a number of strategies, one of which will be a new, purpose built “Sentenced to a Skill” Boot Camp for Alice Springs.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">These key measure would work alongside the CLP’s four-point plan to tackle crime which includes:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Youth Justice being immediately returned to Corrections. The Department of Corrections is best placed to correct the behaviour plaguing our communities. Territory Families will focus on the care and protection of children, and Police and Corrections, along with relevant NGOs, will be given the tools they need to take back control of our streets.</span></li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Youth offenders who are placed in diversion will undertake community service. The community deserves to see real consequences and community service offers a meaningful and effective option if incarceration is not required.</span></li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Victims will be put first. Territorians have had enough of the Labor Government’s ‘offender first’ policies where the victim is forgotten. The toll of crime in our community cannot be sustained and a strong message needs to be sent to offenders.</span></li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Community-centred solutions will be prioritised. The best answers to crime often come from the communities impacted, and they will be different across our Territory. Solutions like curfew in Alice Springs, if supported by the Alice Springs community, will be implemented.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A CLP Government would also have a six-pronged approach to supporting the Territory’s police force.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A CLP Government would commit to:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Making police a top priority, guaranteeing the police portfolio will be held by the Chief Minister. This ensures that the concerns of police and public safety are always at the forefront of government decision making.</span></li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Rolling police recruitment and sufficient funding provided to ensure that multiple recruit squads can run at the same time. Priority will be given to backfilling vacant positions, in major centres and the bush, as well as meeting attrition rates and keeping the police college appropriately skilled and resourced.</span></li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Rolling back youth justice changes. Reverse the watering down of penalties for youth offenders and institute a system where each offence has a consequence including escalating consequences for youth offenders.</span></li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Increase penalties for the assault and abuse of police officers. There is an average of 230 assaults on police each year. A clear message will be sent to people who assault or abuse police by introducing stronger and more certain consequences for those who assault or abuse police.</span></li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Focusing on remote policing by working with the Federal Government for additional resources to ensure remote police stations are manned as necessary and ensure that housing and staffing meet contemporary requirements.</span></li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Provide greater opportunities for promotion for Territory-trained police officers in order to reward the commitment and local knowledge gained.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>My plan to fix crime in Alice Springs – Robyn Lambley (Araluen)</b></span></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Step1 &#8211; Acknowledge the Problem</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">If I were the NT Government in charge of tackling crime in Alice Springs I would firstly publicly <b>acknowledge that there is a serious crime problem in Central Australia</b>. I would address the people of Alice Springs and acknowledge that the current crime prevention strategies, whilst well intended, are simply not working. I would make a public commitment to work collaboratively with local people to address the escalating problem of crime in Alice Springs using a balanced, sensible, carrot and stick approach. My plan to tackle crime in Alice Springs requires <b>a whole of Government and whole of community approach. </b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Step 2 – Identify Strategies</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">I would separate the plan to tackle crime in Alice Springs and Central Australia into <b>short, medium and long term strategies</b>. The priority must be restoring law and order in the short term. The state of lawlessness we have in Alice Springs at present is completely unacceptable. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">An audit must be undertaken into NT Government expenditure into youth services and an assessment of bang for buck. Are we getting the services we need to assist youth in Alice Springs? Are the youth services inadvertently enabling youth crime or helping kids to make better choices?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Step 3 – Implement a Youth Curfew</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">I would immediately implement an <b>emergency Youth Curfew for children</b>.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">This would require all children to be off the street between the hours of 8pm and 6am. Parents and carers would be responsible for ensuring their children do not breach the Curfew. Like during the COVID 19 shut down in March / April 2020, the Police would be tasked to confront people that are not adhering to the Curfew. Territory Families would have a primary role in supporting families to comply with the Curfew. All Government funded youth services would be required to assist in compliance and supporting the implementation of the Curfew. If agencies decide they are ethically or otherwise opposed the Curfew they may risk losing their NTG funding. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">The Curfew would be a Child Protection strategy designed to keep children safe and get them off the streets at night, so as to minimise the opportunity to commit crimes. The Curfew would remain in place for as long as it takes to see a significant change in behaviour of children, parents and carers. We saw after three weeks of the COVID lockdown that people did comply and crime was reduced to the lowest level we had seen in years. Although temporary, the curfew may remain in place for many months, as required to change behaviour.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Penalties for breaching the curfew may be considered if people refuse to comply.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Step 4 – Examine Legislative Changes</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">As Legislators I would be looking at <b>strengthening all legislation pertaining to juvenile justice, to ensure the safety of children and the broader community</b>. The bail laws passed by the Gunner Government in early 2020 have been the greatest contributor to the current state of lawlessness in Alice Springs. These laws need to be changed to ensure that the revolving door of juvenile offending stops. Laws must be amended to reinstate personal and parental responsibility. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Step 5 – Bush Youth Camps</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Troubled kids need to be provided respite. Being taken away from the harmful influences and pressure is proven to be one of the best ways to help kids to start thinking clearly and to regain their physical and mental health. <b>Bush youth camps</b> must be rolled out to get these kids away from harmful influences. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Step 6 – Child Protection</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Child Protection is still one of the greatest shames in the NT. The number of children that continue to be abused and neglected in the NT is an absolute disgrace. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Territory Families, the NT Child Protection authority, needs a shake up from top to bottom again!</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">The bar continues to be set so low we are meant to accept that children roaming the streets at night is OK. It is far from acceptable. Children have a right to safety, education and care. Their right to roam freely at night without adult supervision is a form of neglect promoted by people without a true understanding of the vulnerability of children and the trauma they suffer being allowed to behave in this way. If children need to escape violence or abuse at home, then they are clearly “at risk” and should be provided Child Protection assistance through Territory Families. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">I question the effectiveness of the multiple “inquiries” into child abuse in the NT over the past 20 years: Little Children are Sacred, Growing them Strong Together or the 2017, Royal Commission into Child Protection and Youth Detention, just to name a few. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Caring for children is not rocket science, yet we continue to have the highest rates of abuse, neglect and sexually transmitted diseases in children in Australia.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">What we are doing it not working. <b>We are continuing to fail children.</b> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">The NT needs to have some frank conversations about child protection. The statistics show the problem in the NT is primarily an Aboriginal one and I suspect the solutions lie within Aboriginal communities and families. I think a good Government needs to boldly tackle these issues. They might be accused of being racist but they might just save children’s lives or at least save them from a lifetime of misery and abuse.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Step 6 – Alcohol Reduction Strategies</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">The latest NT Police Crime Statistics say one thing very clearly, that the alcohol strategies we have in place are no longer working. Assaults in Alice Springs are up by 20%, Domestic Violence is up by 30%. Added to this, the NT has the highest rate of murder or homicide in Australia. Alcohol is the main contributing factor in most assaults and murders.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Urgent attention needs to be given to changing or modifying our alcohol reduction strategies. </b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">My approach would be to actually target the drunks and problem drinkers. The broad brush approach preferred by the Gunner Government does little to actually identify the real drunks that neglect their children and terrorise their families. I do not believe the NT Liquor Commission is functional or effective. I would scrap it </span><span class=\"s1\">s</span><span class=\"s2\">aving approximately $1m per annum and redirect those funds to put more Police on the beat.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Step 7 – Boost Police Services</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">The Police Service in Alice Springs must be boosted to implement the emergency curfew and restore law and order. <b>The streets of Alice Springs need to be saturated with Police</b> sending a message of zero tolerance. This would be a temporary but powerful measure to assist in the behavioural changes that need to occur.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Step 8 – Central Australian Economic Reconstruction</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">You cannot talk about economic development in Central Australia without addressing crime. The cost of crime to business is phenomenal, let alone the impact on population growth and attracting workers to our town.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">I would immediately task <b>the Minister for Central Australia Economic Reconstruction (currently a portfolio held by Chansey Paech) to become the leader of economic and social reform in Alice Springs and Central Australia. </b>The Minister would be tasked to bring the whole of Government and the whole of community together to fight crime. This work would be actively supported by the Chief Minister and Cabinet. Presently this upper level coordination and leadership is absent. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">I would expect this Minister to work tirelessly to bring about the changes required to reduce crime and restore Alice Springs as a safe and attractive place to live, work and visit.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Step 9 – Effective Leadership</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>The Chief Minister would be a true leader for all Territorians.</b> The Chief Minister’s participation in tackling crime in Alice Springs must be seen and felt. Alice Springs should have access to the Chief Minister and his Cabinet Ministers. They support us and we will support them.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Step 10 – School Attendance </b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">To deny a child an education is a form of neglect and abuse. With truancy levels so high in the NT, we again are failing these children.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><b>The role of truancy officers in the NT needs to be strengthened</b>. The Department of Education must work as a part of the whole of Government approach to tackling crime by assisting to actively identify children that are not attending school. Families need to be assisted to get their children to school. Chronic non-attendance at school must be viewed as a Child Protection issue.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Extra estimated cost for 12 months $5m.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">More Police </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">More Child Protection workers </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">More Bush camps</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Funds can be redirected from underperforming areas of Government to assist in this emergency response eg. NT Liquor Commission, Level 5 Political Advisors</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Note:</strong> The intention of the three Alice Springs MLAs joining forces is to have a louder voice demanding action from the Gunner Government on crime. Our ideas and policies on crime are similar in respect of wanting legislative changes around the bail laws for juveniles; our support for youth camps; the view that personal and parental responsibility are critical to the solution; and a deep concern about the lack of leadership and action from the Gunner Government.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">As an Independent Member of Parliament my views remain my own. </span></p>",

And if so, are we prepared for it?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I&#8217;m a resident of Alice Springs – I&#8217;ve been here since 1997. Together with a friend, I decided to try to find out. I think the information we gathered gives cause for alarm, but judge for yourselves. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Anyone reading the national or international press will realise that the NMD system undermines processes for nuclear disarmament – by altering the strategic balance – and threatens to usher in a new era of the arms race. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">China is upset by NMD and Australia&#8217;s support of it. Despite China&#8217;s threat of economic sanctions against Australia, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer has expressed his Government&#8217;s whole-hearted support of the project and Pine Gap&#8217;s role in it.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">China seems to be the principal threat identified by the US, at least for the moment. Should the international situation ever deteriorate to the point that China attacked Pine Gap, in order to destroy a crucial part of the US intelligence system, what would happen to Alice Springs, just 19 kilometres away? What plans are in place should the base be attacked? </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The simple answer is that there are none, or at least none that stand much chance of being effective. I had a series of telephone calls, visits and conversations with personnel at the base, Emergency Services, the Alice Springs Hospital and Police, which all revealed this simple fact: the plans being developed do not specifically provide for the possibility of an attack on Pine Gap and are inadequate for such an eventuality.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It has never been easy to get good, accurate information about the US base at Pine Gap. (Misinformation? That&#8217;s another story.) The last research concerning an effective emergency plan for Alice Springs in the event of nuclear attack on Pine Gap seems to have taken place in 1987, the last time the base was a really &#8220;hot&#8221; issue. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The research – a Department of Defense document, &#8220;Civil Defense Planning Against a Nuclear Attack on the Joint Defense Facilities&#8221; (prepared by the Strategic and International Policy Division and Natural Disasters Organisation) – is old, but few of the pertinent facts have changed very much. One merely needs to substitute &#8220;China&#8221; for &#8220;Russia&#8221; and try to take into account increases in population and the expansion of the town area towards Pine Gap and hence the increased vulnerability for some residents. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">One of the main things that hasn&#8217;t changed is that, despite the 1987 research and subsequent recommendations, there is still no disaster plan for Alice Springs in the event of a nuclear attack on the US base. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The report cited above states (page 13, paragraphs 44-45): </span><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;Notwithstanding the remoteness of the risk of nuclear attack on the joint defense facilities, there is an overwhelming incentive for precautionary action to be taken in this area.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> “Among the issues that might be examined are how best to arrange:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>preparation of evacuation plans for each of the communities; </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\" style=\"padding-left: 80px;\"><span class=\"s1\">development of procedures for warning the communities about a nuclear attack; </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\" style=\"padding-left: 80px;\"><span class=\"s1\">conduct of shelter surveys and the development of shelter plans; </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\" style=\"padding-left: 80px;\"><span class=\"s1\">initiation of liaison programs by State and Territory Government emergency service organizations with local communities, to make them aware of the effects of nuclear weapons and civil defense arrangements for their protection; and </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\" style=\"padding-left: 80px;\"><span class=\"s1\">transport and communications, medical, food and clothing requirements in the event of nuclear attack. “</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">None of these recommendations have been followed. In the absence of the base being removed, these remain, generally, the most practical measures available, although further work could be done to refine them. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">New disaster and emergency plans for the town are currently in draft form and it is not known when they will be complete. Although they do not cover the possibility of a nuclear attack, they do define the responsibilities of the various agencies. Unfortunately, there is no public comment period for these plans. Upon completion copies will be lodged with the various agencies concerned and with some libraries.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">On contacting the US base I discovered that plans for base personnel in the event of an attack are not available to the public. John McCarthy, Deputy Chief of Facility, explained that the Territory Emergency Services would be responsible for assistance to the town population in the event of an attack. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This seems to imply that the base does not see itself as responsible for such a contingency and that the town of Alice Springs wears both the risk of being the potential target and the responsibility for coping with and cleaning up after an attack. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">A group of doctors, coordinated by Philip Nitschke, who analysed the Department of Defence document in 1988 agreed that evacuation would be the best method of preventing injury and death on a large scale. Evacuation however fails to cover the contingency of an accidental or guerrilla attack. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Further, there is no evacuation plan for the whole town. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Emergency Services do, however, have protocols for developing evacuation plans in the event of an evacuation being necessary.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Evacuation also depends on governments having an excellent idea of potential threat and being both brave and caring enough to initiate an evacuation procedure at an early stage of any perceived threat, despite the financial costs. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Intelligence gathered at the base might well permit the Australian Government the ability to initiate such an evacuation, but in general it seems the base does not supply the Australian Government with significant intelligence. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Whether the US would supply intelligence of that sort may also depend upon strategic considerations. The US might feel compelled to maintain secrecy about how much it does know and what sources it is monitoring: an evacuation of Alice Springs might indicate to a potential enemy that the US is able to monitor messages concerning an attack on the base. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It may be relevant to note that recent bombings of Iraq did not result in any notification of the Alice Springs population that there might be a threat of counter attack. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Evacuation in response to an attack that has already been launched is not viable, as the available warning is likely to be less than one hour. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Local head of Emergency Services, Iain Burns, explained that a nuclear attack would be dealt with by the current disaster plan. He accepted that a nuclear attack would raise particularly difficult problems, especially the electromagnetic pulse (more on this next week),<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>which would knock out the electrical power grid and most if not all electrically dependent communication systems. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He asserted, however, that that draft disaster plan should allow a strategy to be developed that would endeavour to meet that eventuality. Specific disaster plans are only developed for scenarios that seem to be a particularly high risk. Mr Burns said a nuclear attack on Pine Gap is deemed a very, very low risk. Internal sources have told me that the Alice Springs Hospital does not have a plan to cope with a nuclear emergency, although plans are in place to deal with other sorts of emergency and large increases in patients. The hospital has apparently not stockpiled selected treatments, such as iodine tablets, against the possibility of a nuclear attack and would be unable to cope with a massive influx of burns, breaks, severe cuts and radiation poisonings.</span></p>",

Ms McCoy and Dr Hickey, who are partners, replied to questions together.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s2\">NEWS: </span></strong><span class=\"s1\">A small but troublesome group of out-of-control kids are committing crimes. What do you suggest as the best way forward to curb this and settle tensions?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">TOMLINS: </span></strong><span class=\"s3\">Reconnecting the kids back on country to their family and culture. This gets them off the streets where they are causing trouble. I do not support the use of a curfew. This will mean more kids in custody and more institutionalisation. Better to have a 24 hours, 7-day accessible refuge to temporarily house these kids and reconnect them back to country. People need to realise not all these kids are Arrernte kids, they sometimes come from far away and caught up in the current system.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">NEWS: </span></strong><span class=\"s4\">Whom do you see as key groups that can help in regard to this?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">TOMLINS: </span></strong><span class=\"s3\">Government and Indigenous organisations can get behind community initiatives like Children’s Ground and Dreaming Australia that did the Bonnet Series on my home community at Snake Well. We have already had many in the Alice Springs community and business wanting to help. We now need a way so they can help, volunteering to share their skills and upskill our kids. This is what we see as self-determination in practice. We strengthen Alice Springs’ community by strengthening communities, out on country.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">NEWS: </span></strong><span class=\"s4\">What role should the police play? </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">TOMLINS: </span></strong><span class=\"s3\">I support the concept of restorative justice as advocated by retired police officer Terry O’Connell and others. The Remote Indigenous Parenting Association (RIPA) have had a number of very successful trials where they deal with problem kids in the context of relationships not just to the law but to their family, to the community, to the victims of crime. Peace should be at the centre of this mediating role.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><strong><span class=\"s2\">McCOY, HICKEY:</span></strong><span class=\"s1\"> We must increase support and therapies for children and their families and communities. Police should support this in a facilitator role as per restorative policing practices, making police part of the therapy process. Police will need training in trauma informed care, unconscious bias training, history of colonisation in Alice Springs, debriefing and supervision by trained therapists, and training in nonviolent communication.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s4\"><strong>NEWS:</strong> The tourist industry in Alice Springs (not Ayers Rock Resort) has been in long-time decline before COVID. It now needs to be rebuilt from the ground up, how do suggest this is done?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">TOMLINS: </span></strong><span class=\"s3\">Tourism will not stop. People want to come to the centre. It comes and goes; we should not get caught up on that. The country and the people remain forever. This is what attracts people to the Territory. So, let’s build the culture.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">McCOY, HICKEY: </span></strong><span class=\"s5\">COVID changes everything and forces domestic market as per border and internal management COVID needs. There is no guarantee of any quick fix, so we agree it is a time to build from the ground up. Much tourism is likely to be by road. Upgrades of facilities at roadhouses is needed. Make the road into Alice attractive. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>NEWS:</strong> What role should Aborigines have in tourism?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>McCOY, HICKEY:</strong> We need to p</span><span class=\"s5\">rovide support to Aboriginal people who express a desire run tourism ventures. Aboriginal cultural tourism is scant. A huge effort involving and led by Aboriginal Custodians could be developed, for example, all signage for places should be primarily the Aboriginal name to express a desire to run tourism. Tourism old and new needs to be made restorative, non-invasive culturally and environmentally.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>NEWS:</strong> What role do big events take?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">McCOY, HICKEY: </span></strong><span class=\"s5\">Tourism is part of the general story about Alice Springs vitality. There are already many attractive events already in Alice Springs in the tourist season. We need promotion of what is unique and special about Alice Springs.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>NEWS:</strong> What can be done about the town’s centre?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">McCOY, HICKEY: </span></strong><span class=\"s5\">It needs to be revitalised through culture and arts and rent adjustments to assist new and inventive start-up ventures. </span><span class=\"s5\">All tourism needs to be incentivised to be environmentally restorative in practice. This is necessary in this time of climate heating and environmental degradation and can be an attraction. For example, the Finke Desert Race could have an electric vehicle section</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">NEWS: </span></strong><span class=\"s4\">How should our national parks be managed to make them the tourist attraction they deserve to be?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">TOMLINS: </span></strong><span class=\"s3\">Banning fracking is vital for protecting national parks and tourism. Indigenous ranger programs are a great success and we should employ more Indigenous rangers and allow them to educate the public and other national parks’ staff. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><strong><span class=\"s2\">McCOY, HICKEY: </span></strong><span class=\"s1\">Feral animals and plants run amok in them while community people get downgraded by CDP’s useless activities. As so often requested by Aboriginal Custodians, I support getting them out there in important stewardship jobs that tune into their best spirit. Parks are under stress from climate heating, anything we can do to stop this e.g. ban fracking, clean energy, will help.,</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">NEWS: </span></strong><span class=\"s4\">Will you make the national Aboriginal art gallery a reality? How?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">TOMLINS: </span></strong><span class=\"s3\">As an Arrernte Elder I support a National Aboriginal Art gallery in Alice Springs. I am not in a position to comment on the location as this is a decision for the custodians of any site.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">McCOY, HICKEY: </span></strong><span class=\"s5\">Site decisions will be led by Traditional Custodians of sites. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>NEWS:</strong> Do you have plans for w</span><span class=\"s4\">ater management – exploration, fracking, recycling?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">TOMLINS: </span></strong><span class=\"s3\">The NT and Australian Greens policy is total ban on fracking. That’s all fracking. This is the only way to have long term protection of water. We live in a desert climate. I would then focus on basic issues of water security like installing 10-20,000 litre rainwater tanks on houses. Solar energy is an obvious solution for the Territory. This may need government subsidies.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>McCOY, HICKEY:</strong> We need s</span><span class=\"s5\">ound ecological management, reversing carbon pollution. Stopping fracking and other activities that do not care for water security. Water security is a prime policy of the NT Greens and </span><span class=\"s2\">we’ll legislate a right to safe drinking water in the NT. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>NEWS:</strong> What would you do about flood mitigation?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>ALL THREE:</strong> We have read the 2017 NT DIPL report on flood prevention in Alice Springs. We have no objections to its limited scope of action, but action is necessary. The community education and preparation sections need to include retro converting properties to slow flood runoff e.g. absorbent surfaces, rainwater tanks, swales, which can reduce town area contribution and be restorative to water security and land. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>NEWS:</strong> What about works in the catchment ares, a dam, for example?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>ALL THREE:</strong> Similar non-invasive measures to reduce rapid runoff in the catchments can be added, working with Aboriginal custodians. Reversing climate heating with clean energy development and no fracking are basic to reducing severe floods including promoting ground cover to reduce rapid run off and erosion.\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>NEWS:</strong> What would be your measures for r</span><span class=\"s4\">educing our debt to a per-capita level comparable with the other states?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p11\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>NEWS:</strong> This is not </span><span class=\"s5\">feasible in the short term but with maximal and sustained measures to improve environmental, social and personal health and local self sufficiency input costs will decrease dramatically in the medium to long term.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p11\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">TOMLINS: </span></strong><span class=\"s3\">What I would like to know is, with such a small population and many of us especially, Indigenous people basically in poverty, how is it possible the Territory can be in such debt. Where did the money go?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>NEWS:</strong> What are your thoughts about d</span><span class=\"s4\">ecreasing reliance of our economy on government handouts and attracting entrepreneurs boosting the economy through their own initiatives?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">TOMLINS: </span></strong><span class=\"s3\">We already have programs like the Bonnet series which was an entrepreneur initiative of the northern Arrernte communities where we have brought artists and technology into communities to share their skills with us and we share our culture and country. We can provide jobs for Alice Springs people and the kids now on the streets, but we think we can do this best as community exchange.</span></p>\r\n<span class=\"s1\"><strong>McCOY, HICKEY:</strong> In</span><span class=\"s5\"> a COVID world entrepreneurship needs to be encouraged at all levels especially locally including micro businesses, leading to sustainable, widespread and resilient self sustaining economy that is resistant to downturns due to its variety. </span><span class=\"s1\">These need to be culturally, environmentally, and socially restorative businesses as these are the only ways to growth in medium to long term</span>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s4\"><strong>NEWS:</strong> Should the Feds again take over the NT?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">TOMLINS: </span></strong><span class=\"s3\">When over 80% of Territorians have repeatedly said no to fracking yet we know the Commonwealth Coalition is pro gas because of their multi million dollar business donations received from the fossil fuel industry, and the Federal Government also forced the military Intervention on us thirteen years ago, we 100% need more independence from the Feds not less and a better, healthier renewable energy society in the Territory.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">McCOY, HICKEY: </span></strong><span class=\"s5\">The Feds should not take over the NT. They and the NT Government need to make and implement healthier policies for people and environment. A better question would be should the smaller community councils be brought back? Yes. We will support the formation of decision-making bodies in communities which are representative of all community members and cede control of policy-making to those bodies. Government has a role in drawing together stakeholders and other organisations with community leaders to share fair partnerships.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>NEWS:</strong> Who </span><span class=\"s4\">will you give your preferences to?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">TOMLINS: </span></strong><span class=\"s3\">For me, the two main issues in this election are banning fracking and kids on country. So whichever candidates have the best action plan on these issues and other NT Greens policies will get my preferences. The CLP are pro-fracking. Territory Alliance is partially pro-fracking. The ALP betrayed the people of the Territory in the Gunner deal. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>McCOY, HICKEY:</strong> We </span><span class=\"s5\">will give our preferences, in order, to whichever candidates are closest to the Greens’ NT policies overall, without fear or favour, without any preference deals.</span></p>",

      "rendered": "<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The power of ordinary people </span></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Comments by <strong>Jennifer Taylor</strong> at the launch of <i>Peace Crimes </i>by Kieran Finnane, Anzac Hill, August 1, 2020.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>I acknowledge Mr Stephens and Mr Wallace, and all Arrernte elders of the past and future. I thank you for the privilege of meeting here in magnificent Arrernte country. I acknowledge that this country was never ceded by Arrernte people – not the town and the hill we stand on today, nor the land where Pine Gap base has been built.</i></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Kieran Finnane&#8217;s book <i>Peace Crimes </i>is an enormous achievement. A spooky silence often prevails around Pine Gap. Kieran&#8217;s book stands in contradiction to that silence. She takes the intellectual and political position that the functioning of the military facility at Pine Gap, and agreements between Australian and US governments, should be out in the open. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">She has analysed swathes of technical information about the Base&#8217;s role in facilitating high-tech warfare. She confronts the part it plays in lethal, illegal drone strikes against citizens of countries with whom Australia is not at war, and the human consequences of this lawlessness.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">She explores the motivations and methods of the Peace Pilgrims – what led to their actions at Pine Gap, and to their trial for trespass, under the <i>Defence (Special Undertakings) Act</i>. With care and clarity she unpacks the trial. We see how the law is applied in this instance of what she wryly calls &#8216;a reckless act of prayer&#8217;.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">She does this without preaching, or shying away from difficult material. Her approach is connected, clear, inclusive, and above all, compassionate. Her extraordinary commitment to writing this book stands to benefit us all, by amplifying the pilgrims&#8217; message and carrying it further. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">This is a book on a mission. It invites you to engage with the stories of the Pilgrims’ lives and actions. You find you want to know: &#8216;Who are these people? What do they have to say to me? Seeing how they live, how might I live my life?&#8217;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">How does this book do so much, weave all these strands together? The book&#8217;s content, the way it is organised, and its purpose are skilfully braided. Strands of experience, analysis, and reflection are woven together into a new, more complete story about violence, and lives dedicated to peaceful resistance to violence. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Here are some of the strands:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">the multicoloured threads of the pilgrims&#8217; lives, their faith and principles, their activist predecessors, their music, imagery and language, their grief, courage and determination</span></li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">The philosophy and practice of non-violent direct action</span></li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">Kieran&#8217;s own family and community ties, her deep reflections.</span></li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">The continuum of destruction of Aboriginal lives, livelihoods, language and culture from Frontier Wars through to today. </span></li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">The wars in which Pine Gap has played a part, from Vietnam onwards.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Readers will find many different places to land – many points of connection relating to their own stories. For me the book prompted memories of the environmental actions of the 1980&#8217;s: Terania Creek; Franklin Dam; the Daintree road. Also of the womens&#8217; collectives helping women prepare for NVDA at Roxby Downs, the Women for Survival Peace Camp at Pine Gap in 1983, Lucas Heights, Cockburn Sound, Jabiluka, Anzac Day protests and other actions. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The Pilgrims&#8217; stories reminded me how with NVDA, activists choose to be exposed to harm, to be vulnerable, to experience in their own bodies the power of the small and ordinary, the power of standing together, of care and nurture, and the power to refuse violence. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In a Women for Survival newsletter from 1983 I found these favourite lines from Judy Grahn:</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8216;the common woman is as common as the best of bread</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">and will rise&#8217;.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Words echoed by Peace Pilgrim Margaret Pestorious as she insists she does &#8216;all those ordinary things that ordinary people do&#8217; – &#8216;putting my ordinary little body on the line&#8217;. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8216;… being a non-violent activist is about disruption, stopping harms, facing up, witnessing, speaking truth to power&#8217;.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">This book will have done its work when ordinary people who read it find their own ways to take action on the issues that move them most, whether that means anti-racism work, climate action, protecting country, strengthening culture and community, working for food and water security, standing for office, making music, lamenting our losses, or creating images or texts that, like this one, acclaim life and inspire change. </span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>The light and the dark</h3>\r\n<span class=\"s1\">Comments by <strong>Rusell Goldflam</strong> at the launch of <i>Peace Crimes </i>by Kieran Finnane, Anzac Hill, August 1, 2020.</span>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">For five decades, the rallying cry of the protest movement against the space base, as it&#8217;s locally known, has been &#8220;Close Pine Gap&#8221;. Somewhat paradoxically, though, one of the key objectives of that movement has been to open Pine Gap, to shed light on what it actually does. And at its shining heart, that&#8217;s the achievement of Kieran Finnane&#8217;s book, <i>Peace Crimes: Pine Gap, national security and dissent</i>. It sheds light. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This should be no surprise. After all, as a journalist, that&#8217;s Finnane&#8217;s job: to observe, to inquire, to dig down into dark places, and to illuminate them. And there&#8217;s no darker, deeper place around here than Pine Gap. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Finnane could have written a whole book just about that darkness, the dark business of what Pine Gap does and how it does it: about shadowy networks of hovering geostationary satellites; about covert committees meeting in closed rooms to decide where to focus antennas so as to suck up all manner of electronic data and eavesdrop on whoever, wherever they choose; about Pine Gap’s key role in carrying out extrajudicial terminations – or to use plainer language, murders – by targeting drone strikes in places we&#8217;ve never heard of, assassinating people whose names we&#8217;ll never hear. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">About how thanks to the embarrassingly supine compliance and complicity of successive Australian governments with the United States military apparatus, Pine Gap has entangled us all in a radically dangerous geopolitical game, dicing with arbitrary death and mass destruction. Finnane has indeed documented all these things here, and she does so with admirable clarity, concision and precision, but peering into the darkness through the cracks in the formidable edifice of secrecy that conceals Pine Gap isn&#8217;t what this book is really about. If it were, a better title might have been &#8220;War Crimes&#8221;, not &#8220;Peace Crimes&#8221;. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">No, what grips Finnane and what she comes to grips with after penetrating that dark matter, is the most gripping part of this book, the bright bit, the bit where the light gets into the crack that is in everything, the Leonard Cohen line quoted in the closing address to an Alice Springs jury sitting in that overweening, gleaming space capsule of a courthouse, near the end of the Supreme Court trials of the Peace Pilgrims, the perpetrators of the &#8220;peace crimes&#8221; this book is named for. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Finnane carefully and methodically describes how on 28 September 2016, five of the Peace Pilgrims walked into the Pine Gap prohibited area. She also describes how on the same night, a drone strike authorised by President Obama killed fifteen people in the village of Shadal in the Achin district of Nangahar province, Afghanistan. According to the United Nations mission in Afghanistan, most and perhaps all of the victims were civilians. According to Washington, they were all terrorists. As they explained to the jury in their trial a little over a year later, the Peace Pilgrims entered Pine Gap to disrupt the operations of the base in order to stop civilians being murdered by drone strikes like the one on the village of Shadal that night. The Peace Pilgrims said that they did what they did for a simple, fundamental reason. It was necessary. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I dare say that most people, whether they support or oppose Pine Gap, assume that the Peace Pilgrims are fruitcakes and even nutjobs, casually dismissing them as &#8220;weirdos&#8221;. That indeed is what I thought when I first heard about them.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Finnane conscientiously and compellingly dismantles that prejudiced and prejudicial caricature, and draws us in to the quiet, committed, rigorous, loving world of Margaret, Jim, Franz, Andy, Tim and Paul. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Over a period spanning 12 years, I got to know them and their fellow Christian activists, the Pine Gap Four, who had undertaken a similar action in 2005, in my capacity as their intermittent solicitor, and in that capacity I discovered that actually, they are the very opposite of weird. There&#8217;s nothing at all uncanny about them. Indeed, as courtroom tacticians, they were very canny indeed. Finnane deftly describes, with thinly disguised delight, how they made the QCs who&#8217;d been flown in from interstate at taxpayer expense to prosecute them flounder and squirm. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The Pine Gap Four eventually had their convictions overturned thanks to some even cleverer QCs who flew in from interstate (at their own expense) to help out. In 2017, the Peace Pilgrims couldn&#8217;t and didn&#8217;t avoid conviction (because in the interim, the Commonwealth Parliament had amended the law to plug the gap the cleverer QCs had exposed). </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I say &#8220;couldn&#8217;t avoid conviction&#8221; because unlike juries in England, the United States and New Zealand, no Australian jury has ever been defiant and independent enough to ignore a judge&#8217;s directions and acquit after being instructed that no legally available defence has been raised by the accused in a civil disobedience case like this. The Australian citizenry is unusually compliant.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">But the Peace Pilgrims, without a lawyer to represent them in their trial, did something that had never been done before, not even by the Pine Gap Four: they opened Pine Gap, by persuading the trial judge to allow the jury to hear evidence from experts about what Pine Gap actually does, including an extraordinary interview with the late Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser in which he explained why the base needs to be shut down. Finnane documents, day by day, how the Peace Pilgrims found a crack, and, millimetre by millimetre, prised it open, just enough to allow the light to trickle in. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">That isn&#8217;t weird. It&#8217;s wonderful. It is also extremely rare. Governments go to a great deal of trouble to try to ensure that the legal system does not allow civilly disobedient citizens to prise open cracks in this way. Who knows where this sort of thing might lead? </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This is a remarkable story that needs telling. And we are fortunate that such a remarkably clear-eyed, sharp-eyed, unflinchingly far-sighted member of our community has taken the trouble to tell it for us. Thank you, Kieran.</span></p>",

This follows months of a ban on unaccompanied youth 15 years and under, which has been <a href=\"https://alicespringsnews.com.au/2020/09/01/ongoing-discrimination-at-the-library/\">the subject of debate in the community</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>September 14, 2020 4.15pm </em><strong>Arrest for intending to cause serious harm</strong>\r\n\r\nTwo men will appear before the Alice Springs Local Court charged in relation to the serious assault of a man in Alice Springs earlier this month.\r\n\r\nOn September 4 the men, aged 29 and 34 are alleged to have seriously assaulted a 43-year-old man.\r\n\r\nHe was found in the driveway of an East Side and taken to the hospital where he received treatment for life threatening injuries.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile four people who drove around the Alice Springs CBD in a reckless manner in a stolen motor vehicle at the weekend have been arrested.\r\n\r\nMultiple people fled the stolen vehicle when stopped on Undoolya Road following the successfully deployment of Tyre Deflation Device by front line officers.\r\n\r\nOne of the offenders who attempted to flee was tasered after he allegedly ran at an officer armed with an edged weapon.

Who will it be made up of?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Do you consider incorporating the CARGO TERC (town council, chamber of commerce) submission for a hub and spoke model for the care of youth on the streets?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In the overnight safe houses, will the children be locked up? If not police, who will be collecting them?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">When will you be releasing your tourism policy? Will the Mereenie Loop be a part of that plan (as floated by McIver in TERC takedown)?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The $70m in the budget for the national Aboriginal art gallery is on the lower end of estimates for the whole project (CARGO estimates $315m for a cultural centre and gallery). How much Federal help do you think you could bank on?</span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><em><span class=\"s1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-59457 alignnone\" src=\"https://alicespringsnews.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2592-Robyn-Lambley-ABC-pic-OK.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"130\" height=\"180\" />Sitting Member and candidate for Araluen, Robyn Lambley </span></em></strong><em><span class=\"s1\">(pictured)</span></em><strong><em><span class=\"s1\">, replied, including to more specific questions:</span></em></strong></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tackling Youth Crime in Alice Springs</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">One thing we have learnt through the COVID-19 era is that people can change their behaviour. During this period we saw very few unaccompanied children on the streets of Alice Springs at night. Crime plummeted and we were able to sleep at night.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Now with the coronavirus restrictions lifted, crime has been turned on again.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">With the 2017 Royal Commission into the Detention and Protection of Children in the NT, the pendulum has moved to the extreme. There are now virtually no consequences for most juvenile offending. Territory Alliance believes the pendulum must swing back to a more sensible position when it comes to juvenile justice and community safety.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">It is possible to have a system in which there are real consequences for juvenile offending; in which there are real opportunities for kids to rehabilitate; and in which the safety and well-being of the whole community is maintained. One does not have to negate the other.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Over the past few years youth crime has crippled Alice Springs socially and economically.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">As a part of our response to youth crime in Alice Springs, Territory Alliance wants children off the streets at night. We see it as a hallmark of a caring community that children are kept safe and protected at night, not wandering the streets.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">We acknowledge that there are reasons why some children do not stay at home at night, the most obvious being that home is not safe. This is a Child Protection issue. If a child cannot go home at night, this needs to be investigated and addressed.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Parents and carers have a critical role and responsibility to ensure children are not on the streets at night. We acknowledge that some children are defiant and difficult to manage. However, no parent or carer has the right to relinquish their responsibility for their children when it becomes inconvenient or too hard. Some parents require help and support. Other parents need reminding.</span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Night Time Youth Strategy</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Territory Alliance will implement a Night Time Youth Strategy for Alice Springs which will include most of the components of the current NT Government funded children and youth services, such as accommodation, outreach, bail support, diversion, youth camps and the comprehensive suite of Child Protection services.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">The key difference in the Territory Alliance youth strategy is that it will not be acceptable for children to be on the streets unsupervised by an adult at night. For all intents and purposes this will be a curfew. Children 16 years and under, who are not in the company of an adult, will be required to be off the streets after a certain hour at night. Exemptions will apply to some children, for example children that work at night.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\">We will tackle this as a Child Protection issue.</span><span class=\"s1\"> All NT Government departments and Territory Families funded organisations will be required to participate in this broad approach to identify children “at risk” at night and to assist these children accordingly.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">The NT Police will not be running around the streets at night throwing innocent children into paddy wagons and locking them up. This strategy is not about criminalising children. It is about protecting these children and in doing so, reducing youth crime.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Children found on the streets at night will be asked to go home. If they cannot go home, they will be taken to a safe house where they can stay until a responsible adult is found. This work will be conducted by Government and non-Government youth workers, child protection workers and the Police.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">There are several existing NT Government owned facilities in Alice Springs that could be used as safe houses. </span><span class=\"s2\">The old Police station that was used as a Women’s Shelter</span><span class=\"s1\"> for a period, is available. There is a large youth accommodation facility on Gap Road and a secure accommodation facility on South Terrace that would both be suitable. Any of these facilities can be made more “youth friendly” and could be available for use very quickly.</span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Our vision</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Over time, with on-gong education and a whole of Government approach, the number of children defying the curfew will reduce. Over time parents and carers will also become accustomed to this change in community expectations and Government policy. Pressure will be applied by all Government and Government funded agencies on children and families to comply with the Night Time Youth Strategy.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Consistent with the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, Territory Alliance believes the NT Government has a critical role in ensuring the safety and protection of all children, day and night. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">The Territory Alliance Night Time Youth Strategy is based on the Northbridge (WA) Youth Strategy that has been operating since 2003. This is the most successful, long-term youth curfew in Australia. We are confident that aspects of the Northbridge Strategy can work in Alice Springs.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Territory Alliance will commence the introduction of the Alice Springs Night Time Youth Strategy within the first 100 days of coming to Government. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">The roll out will commence with an extensive education program across Central Australia. People will be advised well in advance that children will not be allowed to be out at night beyond a certain time in Alice Springs.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">This strategy is about keeping the whole community safe. In recent years the practice of children roaming the streets of Alice Springs at night has become </span><span class=\"s2\">normalised</span><span class=\"s1\">. Territory Alliance does not accept that this is normal, healthy or caring. Territory Alliance believes we can do things differently and better.</span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The tourist industry in Alice Springs (not Ayers Rock Resort) has been in long-time decline before COVID. It now needs to be rebuilt from the ground up, how do suggest this is done?</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">With COVID-19 the Australian tourism industry is in survival mode. The future is unclear in terms of Australians being able to travel, let alone international tourists.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Tourism is the number one industry in Alice Springs. It is the largest industry and the largest employer.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">A Territory Alliance Government is committed to stimulating and incentivising the Tourism industry in Central Australia.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">We have been seeking input and feedback directly from the Tourism industry and operators on the ground. </span><span class=\"s3\">We will be releasing our Tourism plan in the near future</span><span class=\"s1\">, that will include how we can rebuild this all important industry.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How should our national parks be managed to make them the tourist attraction they deserve to be? </b>(Ayers Rock / Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park; Kings Canyon/Watarrka National Park; West McDonnell National Park; Finke Gorge / Palm Valley National Park; The Devils Marbles, Witjira National Park.)</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Growing our National Parks as tourism destinations is a crucial part of the future of Tourism for Alice Springs. Past visitor surveys and statistics show that a major factor for visitation to the Alice Springs region is the natural beauty and our National Parks. Attracting private investment into Parks is a critical factor to ensure we are showcasing the best we have to offer.</span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Will you make the national Aboriginal art gallery a reality? How?</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">The National Indigenous Art Gallery and Cultural Centre project has been managed appallingly by the current NT Government. In four years we are yet to have a final decision made on a site. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">The whole process has been divisive and unproductive. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">We have been meeting with Aboriginal stakeholders on this issue. We thing the NAAG is a game changer for Alice Springs and we are committed to make this a reality. A Territory Alliance Government will make a decision on the site of the Art Gallery within the first 100 days.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">We are however concerned about the funding for this project. We are not convinced that the $70m allocated to this project in 2016 is still in the Budget. This is a major concern going forward.</span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Flood mitigation</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">Flood Mitigation has not been a priority for the Gunner Government. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">There appears to be a lacklustre approach to what can potentially be a predictable natural disaster for Alice Springs, like cyclones are for Darwin. In Alice Springs we must always be prepared for the inevitable one in on hundred year flood. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">And apart from that, we have regular flows of the Todd River, that requires the river to be cleared and maintained. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">The Lhere Mparntwe (Todd and Charles Rivers) Management Strategy and the Alice Springs Flood Plain Management Plan have been critical to the future of all Flood Mitigation initiatives for the more than 20 years. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">Territory Alliance will revisit the existing plans and undertake to refresh and revitalise these plans and commitments.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Water management</b> (exploration, fracking, absence of recycling)?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">Territory Alliance has a NO Fracking policy which is primarily about the preservation of our ground water supply.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Reducing our debt to a per-capita level comparable with the other states?</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">Our fiscal and economic policy will be based on the data provided to Territorians on </span><span class=\"s1\">July 31, 2020 by the NT Treasurer.  </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">The NT has not been provided any fiscal or economic forecasts since the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) in November 2019. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">Territory Alliance will manage the finances of the NT in a responsible and prudent fashion, unlike the current Gunner Government. We will continue to provide incentives to secure jobs and businesses whilst maintaining an efficient Public Service. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">Jobs will not be cut from the Public Service. But jobs lost through natural attrition may not be filled.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">Midway through the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic recession, it is difficult to plan exactly how to reign in debt, but at the right time, this must be a priority. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">The NT Debt was driven up by $1.8b in 2016 to approximately  $7b at present. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">This rapid escalation of debt prior to COVID-19 should never have occurred. The financial crisis we are now facing is the legacy of the Gunner Government. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">We entered the pandemic with no war chest, no funds left to cover the crisis we are currently facing.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">A Territory Alliance Government will comply with the Fiscal Integrity and Transparency Act and manage the NT finances competently.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Should the Feds again take over the NT?</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">Another four years of fiscal mismanagement under the Gunner Labor Government could lead to the Federal Government having to take over the NT.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">It is essential the next NT Government take a responsible and prudent approach to managing the finances of the NT.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Whom will you give your preferences to?</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">Territory Alliance has a policy that candidates have the final decision over whom they preference. </span><span class=\"s1\">Preferences are yet to be decided.</span></p>",

      "rendered": "<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>UPDATE August 6, 2020</strong></span>\r\n\r\n<strong>The <em>Alice Springs News</em> put questions raised by Don Fuller about Project Sea Dragon to Chief Minister Michael Gunner. He replied, and Dr Fuller in turn responded to Mr Gunner&#8217;s points. That exchange is below, followed by Dr Fuller&#8217;s full report.</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em><strong>QUESTION BY THE NEWS:</strong> Could you please confirm or correct the facts below about the aquaculture / prawn project Sea Dragon? </em>\r\n\r\n<em>The Core Breeding Centre and Broodstock Maturation Centre was going to be located at Bynoe Harbour, near Darwin; a hatchery at Gunn Point and the Grow-Out Facility at Legune Station. </em><em>The required finance to commence the construction of the project remains unavailable. </em>\r\n\r\n<em>This suggests potential lenders (including NAIF) are concerned about one or more of the following factors: An ability to repay the interest and principal on the loan; the amount of funding required; available collateral to act as security for the loan.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>MR GUNNER&#8217;S ANSWER:</strong> Project Sea Dragon prawn aquaculture project will be the largest of its kind in Australia and will ultimately see the development of up to 10,000 hectares of ponds for black tiger prawn production facilities.\r\n\r\nAt full scale the project has the potential to create around 1500 ongoing jobs, of which around 1000 will be located in the Northern Territory.\r\n\r\nConstruction and earthworks for the Core Breeding and Maturation Centre, located at Bynoe Harbour commenced earlier this year, and early works at the Legune Grow-Out Facility have also been complete.\r\n\r\nSeafarms are committed to delivering this project and have appointed a sole arranger to help secure up to $150m of debt for stage one construction of the project.\r\n\r\n<strong>RESPONSE TO THE CHIEF MINISTER FROM DON FULLER: </strong>As reported, the Chief Minister has been forced to admit that funding issues have impacted the prawn project. He is quoted as saying: &#8220;Unfortunately, it’s that private sector side of things where [the projects] haven’t been able to get the cash … which is frustrating.&#8221;\r\n\r\nMr Gunner, who oversees the major projects portfolio in Cabinet said the company behind the mega prawn farm, Seafarms Australia, had recently managed to raise some private sector funding but was yet to secure a key loan from the federally-funded $5 billion North Australia Infrastructure Facility.\r\n\r\nWhile the company may have appointed a &#8220;sole arranger&#8221; to help secure up to $150m of debt for stage one of the Project, so far neither the wider international or Australian financial market nor the Commonwealth government has shown sufficient confidence in the Project to provide the large amount of  finance required.\r\n\r\nThis has finally been acknowledged by the Chief Minister.\r\n\r\nIt suggests the risks associated with the Project are being assessed as unfavourable by major lenders, compared to the likely financial return. This begs the question as to why the NT government would have spent substantial sums building roads for the Project when there is a risk that the Project will not proceed.\r\n\r\nWould not it have been far more preferable to wait until the private sector and Commonwealth government had completed their economic assessments of the Project before committing Territory funding?\r\n\r\nWould not it have also been preferable if competent economic and financial analysis and assessment were undertaken by the Territory Government before proceeding to spend taxpayer monies in this manner?\r\n\r\nThis prevents limited taxpayer funding being spent on roads likely to have an important economic stimulus effect to key, high performing industries in the Territory, such as tourism.\r\n\r\nA far more certain and guaranteed economic return would have come from sealing the Mereenie Loop road in the centre, for example. This is crucial to tourism recovery in the centre of Australia and would have generated a substantial financial return.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em><strong>QUESTION BY THE NEWS: </strong>The NT Government has completed the road to Gunn Point at a cost of $32.2m. With the Commonwealth it has also been involved in awarding a $58m tender for the first section upgrade of the Keep River Road as a signal of strong financial support for the project. How much to the $58m did the NT contribute?</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Was the principal purpose of these roads, worth together $90m, to serve the Sea Dragon project? What are they used for now?</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>MR GUNNER&#8217;S ANSWER:</strong> The upgrade of Gunn Point Road was 100% funded by the Northern Territory Government and the upgrade of Keep River Plains Road is funded 80% by the Commonwealth and 20% by the Northern Territory Government.\r\n\r\nThere are other purposes and development opportunities that the sealing of these roads support.\r\n\r\nKeep River Plains Road provides access to large parcels of agricultural land, currently being advertised by NT Land Corporation, as well as potential onshore gas.\r\n\r\nGunn Point Road currently serves many different purposes including access to agriculture, mining, tourism and fishing facilities and is also access to the future development of Murrumajuk and Glyde Point.\r\n\r\n<strong>RESPONSE TO THE CHIEF MINISTER FROM DON FULLER: </strong>But, such alternative projects these new roads are supposed to support are blue sky, or rather, likely to be pie in the sky opportunities rather than established, viable economic opportunities.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, the Mereenie Loop and further expenditure in key Territory and national parks for valuable  infrastructure development designed to support the growth of tourism would provide a far higher economic return in the form of jobs and economic activity.\r\n\r\nTourism is an established growth sector for the economy and for the Territory, in particular. While tourism  generates substantial jobs and economic returns to the Territory it has been largely ignored by the Gunner government, too focussed on political point scoring with large, high risk projects without adequate economic and financial analysis and understanding by government.\r\n\r\nThat is, the Gunner government is way out of its depth, to the expense of all Territorians. There have been numerous examples of this during the Gunner government, including the Charles Darwin University inner city Darwin development and the construction of the new grandstand in the Chief Minister’s electorate.\r\n\r\nAdditional examples include evidence disclosed by the Auditor General that the NT Government handed out &#8220;billions of dollars&#8221; in grants without proper record-keeping and without proper oversight and the approval of $10.5m of taxpayer funding to Darwin water bottler NT Beverages, despite the company being deeply in debt and on the brink of financial collapse.\r\n\r\nThis government has shown a fatal lack of competence in economic and financial management and understanding. This has had a major impact on funding and desperately needed support for established industries, such as tourism, vital to the economy of Central Australia.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><b>PROJECT SEA DRAGON – ANOTHER NORTHERN GAMBLE TO BREAK THE BANK?</b></span></p>\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><em>By Dr DON FULLER</em></strong></span>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Background</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">The majority of land-based aquaculture in Australia is concentrated in Queensland. An important exception to this is Humpty Doo Barramundi Farm, located at the headwaters of the Adelaide River. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Queensland has less than 1, 000 hectares dedicated to aquaculture. The majority of this is in prawn farming. However, the industry has not shown evidence of growth for over a decade.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">In part this is due to the fact that prawn farming and aquaculture in general, is a high risk, capital intensive, site specific operation which requires a high degree of technical expertise. It requires management who are flexible and adaptable and able to deal with sudden changes in conditions. Management must be technically proficient and extremely competent in risk management, marketing and liaison with government bodies. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">On 20 December 2013, a company called CO2 Group announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Western Australian Resources Ltd (WARL) had executed agreements to acquire the business and assets of the Queensland prawn aquaculture company Seafarm Pty Ltd. CO2 had been an environmental services company with operations in Australia, New Zealand and South-East Asia. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">In February 2014, CO2 Group was renamed Commodities Group Limited. The Group demerged its environmental business to focus on aquaculture. To this end the ASX Listed Company Commodities Group Limited (ASX:COZ) became the ASX Listed Seafarms Group (ASX: SFG). </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">On April 20, 2018 the Australian Stock Exchange announced the listing of SFG which offered ‘shareholders the opportunity to invest in the company that’s dedicated to operating, building and investing in sustainable aquaculture.’</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">From a concentration on the environmental industry the Group had refocused on the aquaculture industry. This appeared to be a particularly challenging change of direction given the specialized technical skills and high degree of experience required in the field of aquaculture. It also appeared to have little in common with the previous industry the Group had been involved in. Such changed requirements could be expected to be particularly challenging for the senior management and board of this now, quite different, operation. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Project Sea Dragon</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Purchasing the Seafarm prawn operation in Queensland gave the company the platform and justification to become involved in formulating the concept and development of Project Sea Dragon.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">This is a very large scale, integrated, land-based, prawn aquaculture project in Northern Australia. It is proposed to produce year round volumes of prawns for export markets, principally in Asia. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Stage 1 of the Project is proposed to comprise around 1,000 hectares of prawn farming ponds and associated infrastructure. The prawn grow-out facilities are to be located at Legune Station in the Victoria River District of the Northern Territory. In addition, there will be $90 million spent on a range of breeding program, processing and export facilities that will be located in, or near Darwin, Exmouth, Kununurra and Wyndham. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Main Project Component of Project Sea Dragon</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">At full capacity, the Project will consist of the following components:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><b></b><span class=\"s2\">Broodstock facilities and Hatcheries – to breed and raise 100 million post-larvae per year, to be transferred into the production system. </span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">Land-based, pond grow-out facilities. This will consist of 10,000 hectares (100 square kms) of production ponds and an additional 5,000 hectares of additional water treatment ponds/canals. </span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">Product Processing Facilites </span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">Product Export and Transportation Facilities </span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Beside this a number of other infrastructure components are required. These include:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">Feed Mills – to produce pelletised feed products to feed the prawns in the production systems. </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">Feed Raw Materials Supply – agriculture product supply/production systems to access materials for the pelletised feed. These include large quantities of soya beans, lupins, maize and wheat. There is also the need for transportation systems to deliver the materials from growing locations to the Feed Mills </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">Additional support infrastructure is required including;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n \t<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">Electrical Power generation- For driving pumps and aeration systems and also for Feed Mill and Product Processing Facility. </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">It is expected that (1) The Founder Stock Centre and Quarantine Centre will be located at Exmouth, WA. This is where wild caught prawns will be held, tested and bred to produce disease-free stock for the production system. (2) The Core Breeding Centre and Broodstock Maturation Centre will be located at Bynoe Harbour, near Darwin. (3) A Hatchery for spawning and rearing tanks for producing disease-free post larval prawns to stock the grow-out facility, will be located at Gunn Point. (4) The Grow-Out Facility will be based at Legune Station in the N.T. (5) The Processing Plant is to be based at Kununurra. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">This is a huge project.<b> </b>At full capacity, it is estimated that the Project will require capital expenditure of around $1.25 billion. Annual production of prawns is estimated at 125,000 tonnes per annum. The construction stage of the Project will employ around 300 people, with on-going operational employment of around 1,700. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">While the Queensland operations are primarily intended to demonstrate the operating concepts for Project Sea Dragon it is difficult to understand how such concepts can be transferred from what is a relatively small operation of some 160 hectares of growing out ponds and a total production of 1,770 tonnes &#8211; to an enormous scale-up, involving 10,000 hectares and 125,000 tonnes per annum. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">This is not to mention the quite different geographical and climatic characteristics of Northern Western Australia and the Northern Territory to Queensland. Such differences include remoteness from skilled labour, high transport costs and elevated costs of production. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Such barriers to commercial development are likely to be an important reason why such a large-scale aquaculture development has not been attempted anywhere in Australia, much less the extremely challenging Australian North. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">It therefore begs the question why the proponents of such a Project would choose this region of Australia. Is it likely that an important influence has been the possibility of attracting large amounts of government funding, directed at the development of the north?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"> If so, then perhaps the commercial realities including the large scale capital establishment costs and relatively high operating costs become less important to the owners and managers of the enterprise. However, whether such a situation can be maintained in the medium to longer run without substantial appreciation of commercial realities, remains an important question. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Capital Start-Up Requirements</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Since 2014, substantial effort has been expended into attempting to attract the required large amount of capital funding for Project Sea Dragon. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">In a submission to the Inquiry into the Development of Northern Australia, it has been indicated that Seafarms has funded the project development to the completion of a Preliminary Feasibility Study stage (Stage 1) – and is now seeking a partner for the following stages: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">Stage 2 – completion of ‘Bankable Feasibility’ through to the financial investment decision. It is stated that the partner may wish to exit at the completion of Stage 2. However, it is not clear what would be gained by such a decision. Alternatively, it is stated a partner may make a decision to progress to;</span></li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">Stage 3 – Development Funding (Engineering, Procurement, Construction phase); and </span></li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">Stage 4 – Operations. </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">To this end, Seafarms has ‘embarked on a marketing program’ with a number of foreign state-owned enterprises, sovereign and private investment funds, large global food companies and several investment banks. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">In addition, the Group has successfully sought to have the Project recognized as a Project of State Significance in WA and the NT. It has also been given Major Project Status with the Commonwealth Government. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Such a ‘marketing program’ has not been successful in attracting anything like the required funding for the Project from commercial sources of funding. This raises important questions as to the way in which the Project is perceived by experienced commercial financial intermediaries. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">During the last financial year, Seafarms Group announced the following financial events, relating to capital requirements.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">Nippon Suisan Kaisha Ltd, a major Japanese seafood company, undertook an equity investment in Seafarms shares at 10 cents per share equating to an equity raising of $24.99 million on 7 August 2018.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">A share placement to major domestic, institutional and professional investors at 9 cents per share resulted in equity raising of $20 million on 12 April 2019.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">Nippon Suisan Kaisha’s further investment in the Group, pursuant to the top-up rights under the Shareholder Rights Agreement finalised in August 2018 at 9 cents per share resulting in an equity raising of $3 million on 15 May 2019</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">Seafarms Group Sharepurchase Plan, provided eligible shareholders the opportunity to subscribe for up to $15,000 each in Seafarms at 9 cents per share, raised $4.3m on 29 May 2019.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">Equity raising fees were $1.4m. </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">It is noteworthy that on 7 August 2018, Seafarms Group issued 5,320,622 unlisted share options to Nippon Suisan Kaisha (Nissui). The Options are subject to a voluntary 3-year escrow period, have an exercise period of 5 years at an exercise price of 6.2 cents per unlisted option. At the 30 June, 2019, these 5, 320, 622 unlisted options remain unexercised. As the current share price of around 0.051 is well below the exercise price such options are not likely to be exercised. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">On 12 December 2018 the Group issued 50 000 000 and 30 000 000 unlisted share options to AAM Investment partners as part of the transaction involving the Grow-Out facility at Legune Station. Both sets of options are subject to a 12 month escrow period and have an exercise period of 3 years and 5 years respectively at an exercise price of 9.7 cents per unlisted option. At 30 June, 2019, both unlisted options remain exercised and are also unlikely to be exercised due to the falling share price. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">On March 25, 2020 Seafarms Group announced the private placement of 416,666,666 shares at a price of AUD 0.03 per share for gross proceeds of AUD $12,500,000 on March 25, 2020. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Such equity raisings are insufficient for the extensive start-up capital required for even Stage 1 of the Project. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">In a recent update on Financing for the Project the company stated that financing was ‘well advanced’. However, no further details on this were provided, other than to indicate that a ‘number of international banks were at various stages of their due diligence processes’ and that a ‘number of parties were expressing potential interest in direct equity participation’ in the Project.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">However, no finance of any magnitude had materialized. The results of a<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>financial analysis of Seafarms is likely to make the sourcing of the required finance even more problematic for potential investors. A financial analysis of Seafarms would be undertaken by a significant potential investor to Project Sea Dragon. The results of one such financial analysis of Seafarms are discussed in a following section. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Potential Government Involvement</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">As mentioned, Project Sea Dragon has been recognized as a ‘Project of State Significance’ in WA and also the NT and it has been given ‘Major Project Status’ by the Commonwealth government. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Major Project Status from the Commonwealth provides recognition for the Project as having national significance for economic growth and employment for regional Australia. The Project can therefore expect to receive assistance from the Major Projects Facilitation Agency in the coordination and facilitation of Commonwealth government approvals, such as environmental, bio-security, or foreign investment approvals. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Major Project Status in the NT recognizes that such Projects are significant contributors to the economic development of the NT, through the creation of jobs and business opportunities. Such Projects can be expected to receive substantial NT government assistance through the facilitation of the required approvals as well as importantly, assistance with the provision of essential infrastructure, such as roads, bridges and other facilities. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">It is likely that the recognition of Major Project Status by the Commonwealth will also assist a Project to receive funding support from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">This is a Commonwealth Government $5 billion lending facility to assist finance projects via the governments of the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia to achieve growth in the economies and populations of these regions and encourage and complement private sector investment in Northern Australia. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">NAIF can lend up to 100% of the debt for a project, providing the Commonwealth does not bear the majority risk in a project. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">This is likely to prove a very attractive option to Project Sea Dragon, particularly as financial intermediaries in the private sector, both domestic and international, appear reluctant to lend substantial sums to commence construction of the Project. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Current Project Status</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">The Project has been reported by the Company as ‘shovel ready’. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Stage 1 has approvals in place and preparatory tendering has been completed to enable construction to commence. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">However, the required finance to commence the construction of the Project remains unavailable. This suggests potential lenders to the Project are concerned about one or more, of the following factors:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">An ability to repay the interest and principal on the loan.</span></li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">The amount of funding required.</span></li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">Available collateral to act as security for the loan. </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">With respect to the first point, lenders are concerned with what is known as the Debt to Income Ratio. Where this is high, as in the case of the Seafarms Group, lenders will be concerned about the increased risk of undertaking such a loan. In a later section dealing with the Financial Analysis of the Seafarms Group this, and other relevant ratios from the Group’s financial statements will be discussed. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Despite the apparent difficulties being experienced to attract the necessary funding for the commencement of Project Sea Dragon, it has been reported that the Company worked with the NT Government to amend its Project Development Agreement to provide Seafarms with tenure at Bynoe Harbour. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Apparently all approvals are in place, including the development, clearing and aquaculture licenses. The company reported using the ‘current Dry Season to commence clearing for the sites of the broodstock maturation centre at Bynoe Harbour. Inlet and outlet ponds have been formed and site fencing has also commenced.’ </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">One wonders whether such development should have commenced if the required funding is not forthcoming. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Seafarms has signed a Sub-Lease and Cooperation Agreement with AAM Investment Group (AAMIG). AAMIG completed the purchase of the Legune Perpetual Pastoral Lease in December and an arrangement has been made between Seafarms and AAMIG to utilize the land for the grow-out ponds and associated infrastructure. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">In addition to such Company developments the NT Government has completed the road to Gunn Point at a cost of $32.2 million. With the Commonwealth it has also been involved in awarding a $58 million tender for the first section upgrade of the Keep River Road as a signal of strong financial support for the Project. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">It is important to consider what company financial information the NT Government considered before deciding to expend such an amount of taxpayer funds at this stage. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">In particular, information available on the financial status of the Seafarms Group should be regarded as having an important influence on the likely level of risk ascribed to the Project by both commercial and public sector lenders of finance. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">If this Project does not proceed it is almost certain to be the case that expenditure by the NT government could have achieved a far greater return to the Territory community if spent on alternative options. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Financial Analysis</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Earnings and Risk Analysis</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">The on-line financial analyst ‘Simply Wall Street’ has undertaken a financial analysis of the Seafarms Group. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Key findings include the following;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">In 2019 the aquaculture segment of the Group ran at a loss of <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">                            </span>$18, 216, 237. This followed a loss of $14, 262, 502, in the previous year.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">A risk analysis undertaken by the financial analyst found that:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">Earnings have declined by 17.07% over the past five years.</span></li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">The share price has been highly volatile – particularly over the last 3 months.</span></li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">Existing shareholdings have been diluted in the past year, and</span></li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">The Seafarms Group does not have a ‘meaningful’ market capitalisation. </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">With regard to the share price, this reached a high of $0.15 in September 2018. It then fell to 0.10 by 12 September 2019. By 27 March 2020 the share price fell far further, to a low of $0.03. It recovered slightly to $0.049 by 30 June, 2020. This had a major impact on the value of the company and can be expected to have a significant negative impact on the capacity of Seafarms to borrow for Project Sea Dragon. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">On June 19, 2020 Simply Wall Street reported that ‘shareholders will doubtless be very grateful to see the share price up 37% in the last quarter. But that is minimal compensation for the share price under-performing over the last year. The cold reality is that the stock has dropped 40% in one year, under-performing the market.’</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">The analyst goes on to report that given that Seafarms Group didn’t make a profit in the last twelve months the focus should be on revenue growth for anyone interested in investing in the company. Companies without profits it is argued, are expected to grow revenue every year and at a relatively fast pace. Unless this is done it is difficult to be confident that the company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">In the last twelve months Seafarms Group increased its revenue by 2.0%. This is not regarded as a sufficiently high growth rate considering it doesn’t make profits. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">The Balance Sheet is rated as ‘Mediocre’ with ‘weak fundamentals’ &#8211; from the perspective of financial strength. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">A financial ratio analysis of Seafarms Group indicated that the Return on Capital Employed by Shareholders earned a negative 44.5% three years ago, compared with a negative 31.3% last year. The debt to equity ratio of Seafarms is considered high at 44.4%. Seafarms Group debt to equity ratio increased from 35.3% to 44.4% over the last five years. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Such findings act to further constrain the borrowing ability of Seafarms Group. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Ownership Arrangements</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Simply Wall Street notes that the Seafarms Group is characterized by a lack of Institutional Ownership. Institutional ownership is defined as the amount of a company&#8217;s stock owned by organisations such as mutual or pension funds, insurance companies, investment firms, or other large entities that manage funds on behalf of others. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">There are a number of reasons why this might be the case. For example, it may be hard for institutions to purchase larger amounts of shares if the amount traded is low. On the other hand, it is possible that professional investors are avoiding a company because they assess the risk to be too high and the return too low. It is also noted that hedge funds don’t have a meaningful investment in the Seafarms Group. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">As at 30 June 2019, the largest shareholder was Avatar Industries Pty. Ltd. at 20.31%. This was followed by Nippon Suisan Kaisha, Ltd. at 12.68% and Gabor Holdings Pty. Ltd. at 9.74%. According to Simply Wall Street the top 12 shareholders had a combined ownership of 51% implying that the company is not widely held. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Insider ownership of a company can be positive when it signals that leaders of the organisation are thinking like the true owners of a company. However, it may also serve to diminish the influence on decision making of other shareholders, including institutional shareholders. This can be expected to be taken into account and to be of concern to such potential investors. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">The Directors of Seafarms Group as at 30 June, 2019 were Ian Norman Trahar, Harley Ronald Whitcombe, Dr Christopher David Mitchell and Paul John Favretto. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Ian Trahar is the Executive Chairman of the Seafarms Group. He is also a Director and significant shareholder of Avatar Industries Pty. Ltd, an unlisted private company. Ian Trahar is also a Director of Gabor Holdings. In addition, Paul Favretto has held the position of Managing Director of Avatar Industries. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Simply Wall Street notes that Seafarms has no CEO, or no data can be found relating to this position. This is important from a governance and management perspective. Usually for example, the CEO would be responsible for the management of the company with other line managers reporting to the position. Presumably this role is undertaken by the Managing Director of the Seafarms Group. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Trading Query &#8211; Seafarms Group (SFG)<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>by the ASX</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">On 20 April 2020, the ASX Listings Compliance Officer formally wrote to the Company Secretary of Seafarms Group regarding a change in the price of SFG’s securities from an intraday low of $0.055 to an intraday high of $0.074. A significant increase in the volume of SFG’s securities traded was also noted. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">In light of this, the company was asked to respond to a number of questions related to whether the company was aware of ‘any information concerning it that has not been announced to the market which, if known by some in the market, could explain the recent trading in its securities?’</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">The Company Secretary responded that the Company was not aware of any information that had not been announced to the market, which if known by some in the market, could explain the recent trading in the securities. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Summary and Conclusions</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Project Sea Dragon appears as a project on a scale never before attempted in Australia, much less the difficult and testing business and commercial environment of the North of Australia. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">While the Seafarms Group has been involved in aquaculture since 2013, this is not regarded as a particularly long time, given the special technical requirements of this industry. It is also important to note that the prawn farming industry has not grown in Queensland for the last ten years. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">The Project now envisaged by Seafarms is around 10 times larger than the current scale of all aquaculture operations in Queensland. Seafarms has around 160 hectares currently involved with prawn farming in Queensland. An expansion to that of 10,000 hectares of ponds would be at a scale around 63 times larger than their current operations. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">The construction of the required infrastructure, plant and equipment calls for a very large amount of capital, estimated at $1.25 billion. Annual production of prawns is also projected to be over 60 times the current output of Seafarms. On-going operational employment requirements are in the order of nearly 2000 people. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">To date it appears the company has had difficulty getting close to the amount of capital required for such a massive project. It appears that if it is to proceed there will be a need for a significant amount of government funding. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">To be successful the company also faces a number of other major obstacles common to all business enterprises in the North of Australia. This includes difficulties securing a technically skilled and reliable labour force, which is a very important requirement for this particular industry. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Additional obstacles can be expected with regard to remoteness from key suppliers, transport and logistics costs associated with integrating the various stages of the production process and the on-going costs associated with a harsh and unpredictable climate. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">It would appear particularly risky, given such potential obstacles, to attempt to develop this project in such a rapid, large scale, approach.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Experience with successful aquaculture operations in the Territory have demonstrated that it is often necessary to commence at a smaller scale. This enables the necessary learning and understandings to successfully deal with the substantial commercial obstacles in establishing successful commercial operations in the North of Australia. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">For example, it is not clear how prawn aquaculture arrangements will need to change and adapt to the different environmental and climatic conditions of the North of Australia compared to Queensland, or whether certain infections or diseases are likely to be more difficult to manage in a changed environment. Such considerations have previously proved fatal to other primary production enterprises in the North of Australia. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">As pointed out by Glen Morrison in Rural Weekly &#8211; an often-quoted piece of research with regard to large scale primary development in Northern Australia is ‘The Northern Myth: A Study of the Physical and Economic Limits to Agricultural and Pastoral Development in Tropical Australia’, by Davidson. While this related to the Ord River Development, many of the arguments are relevant to large scale development in other projects within primary industry such as aquaculture. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s2\">Davidson concluded the idea to develop the North was “a platitude uncritically accepted by many Australians.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s2\">Davidson’s findings have since been reinforced by a number of independent studies.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s2\">As the Northern Futures Collaborative Research Network suggests there are three big influences shaping Australia, which collide in the North.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s2\">The first is ‘Big Development’. This is often characterised by the drive to build major infrastructure projects, including dams and agricultural development, mining and gas.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s2\">The second is ‘Big Conservation’. This tends to require the North to be like untouched wilderness, a pristine ecology that requires preservation.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s2\">The third are the policies aimed at seeking to promote Indigenous well-being.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s2\">Often these major aspects are considered in isolation of each other. However, for those living in the North, such influences are inseparable. It would therefore prove valuable if government policy makers at both the Commonwealth and Territory levels could spend more time and effort considering where such major influences intersect and the likely implications of such intersections. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s2\">The financial analysis presented by Simply Wall Street highlights important financial challenges facing Seafarms Group. It would seem important that key indicators such as revenue, production and net income will need to increase before key investors can be encouraged to invest in such a Project, given the risks and to the extent required. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s2\">The current financials of the company, are likely to dissuade many investors from becoming involved in such a large scale, high risk project, without more evidence that the obstacles confronting this development can be overcome at reasonable levels of cost and return. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s2\">If the commercial sector is not prepared to lend the required finance then, if the Project is to proceed, it is likely that the principal responsibility will fall on the shoulders of the taxpayer. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s2\">Given the major financial difficulties confronting the NT Government and now the Commonwealth following coronavirus, can this Project really be regarded as an optimum use of limited taxpayer funds, given the significant risks that have been discussed?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s2\">This does not seem to have been a question for the Gunner government to ponder. The NT government has awarded contracts worth $32.2m to upgrade the Gunn Point Road for Project Sea Dragon. It has also become involved in the up-grade of the Keep River Plains Road for the Project.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s2\">On 15 June, 2020 the ABC reported that the Chief Minister was forced to admit that ‘funding issues and the pandemic have impacted the prawn project.’</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s2\">‘Unfortunately, it’s <i>that private sector side of things</i> [Author itlalics] where [the projects] haven’t been able to get the cash … which is frustrating.’ Mr Gunner, who oversees the major projects portfolio in Cabinet said the company behind the mega prawn farm, Seafarms Australia, had recently managed to raise <i>some</i> private sector funding but was yet to secure a key loan from the federally-funded $5 billion North Australia Infrastructure Facility. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s2\">This suggests that the Commonwealth is being far more careful with taxpayer funding than the Gunner Labor government. As the person responsible for major projects in the NT Cabinet, Mr Gunner should appreciate the reasons why the private sector is being far more careful about the ‘headlong’ financing of this project. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s2\">Presumably the Commonwealth is also more cautious about building high cost roads in remote regions’ to no particular place’ or for no particular purpose. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s2\">Commercial operations are required to satisfy the owners of their company that a financing decision is likely to have a positive economic and commercial outcome. No such constraints appear to act on the financial decisions of the Gunner government. Major financial decisions have been undertaken in a number of cases without serious commercial or economic analysis or business plans – often with disastrous results for the Budget. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s2\">Unfortunately government in the Territory face their ‘shareholders’ only once every four years. By then the financial damage done can be almost irretrievable. </span></p>",

Compelling to the core&#8217;. Anna Krien, author of</em> Night Games<em> and </em>Act of Grace.\r\n\r\nAt the closely guarded and secretive military facility, Pine Gap, police arrest six nonviolent activists. Their crime: to step through a fence, lamenting and praying for the dead of war.\r\n\r\nThey call themselves Peace Pilgrims and in Peace Crimes Alice Springs based journalist Kieran Finnane tells the story of their arrest and trial.\r\n\r\nThe Crown called them a threat to national security and demanded gaol time. Their political trials, under harsh Cold War legislation, tell a story of obsessive Australian secrecy about the Australian military presence on our soil and our country’s hardline response to dissent.\r\n\r\nPeace Crimes is a gripping account of what prompted the Pilgrims to risk so much, interweaving local events and their legal aftermath with this century’s disturbing themes of international conflict and high-tech war.\r\n\r\nWhat responsibilities do we have as Australians for the covert military operations of Pine Gap? And what is the role of dissent and protest in the 21st Century?\r\n\r\n<em>Peace Crimes</em> is published by the University of Queensland Press (UQP).\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73395 alignleft\" src=\"https://alicespringsnews.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Kieran-Finnane-2020-230.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"230\" height=\"307\" srcset=\"https://alicespringsnews.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Kieran-Finnane-2020-230.jpg 230w, https://alicespringsnews.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Kieran-Finnane-2020-230-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px\" /><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Kieran Finnane</strong> </span>is a founding journalist of the Alice Spring News, established in 1994, now publishing online.

This is a slightly edited version of comments I made then.\r\n\r\nWe published the first edition of the <em><strong>News</strong></em> on March 3, 1994.\r\n\r\nAn early Macintosh <strong>(pictured below)</strong> was the first computer we owned. Today&#8217;s iPhone has 100,000 times the data capacity and is hundreds of times more powerful.\r\n\r\nIt&#8217;s an example of the velocity of technical changes impacting the newspaper industry in the past 30 years.\r\n\r\nEarly in our publication, printing in Adelaide, Mt Isa or Murray Bridge, we had a copy deadline of 48 hours before the newspaper became available to readers, mostly of them in the town of Alice Springs.\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-85611 alignright\" src=\"https://alicespringsnews.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2838-first-computer-2-scaled-e1660110033747-300x283.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"283\" srcset=\"https://alicespringsnews.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2838-first-computer-2-scaled-e1660110033747-300x283.jpg 300w, https://alicespringsnews.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2838-first-computer-2-scaled-e1660110033747-150x141.jpg 150w, https://alicespringsnews.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2838-first-computer-2-scaled-e1660110033747.jpg 350w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" />Now we can turn around reporting in 10 minutes. Stories are available the world over and more importantly, from Lake Nash to Docker River and Lajamanu to Ernabella – our big outback circulation area in The Centre of Australia.\r\n\r\nPeople out bush no longer have to miss out.\r\n\r\nWe went exclusively online on March 27, 2011, peaking at 22,000 individual readers and up to 100,000 page views a month.\r\n\r\nIt gave us a circulation vastly greater than when we were appearing in print.\r\n\r\nKieran Finnane is the co-founder of the <em><strong>News</strong></em>, and has applied to it her wisdom, profound understanding of the community, her empathy for the not so well off, her writing skills and her respect and love for the region as a journalist and as a citizen.\r\n\r\nOur daughter Jacquie – now Dr Chlanda – was six when we started publishing; our son Rainer, just three. From then on the <em><strong>News</strong></em> was part of their everyday lives and they were both a big help in keeping the family business going.\r\n\r\nJacquie, aged seven or so, to a caller on the phone asking who he was speaking with, replied: &#8220;I am the daughter of the Alice Springs News.&#8221;\r\n\r\nThe printed <em><strong>News</strong></em> was delivered into every letterbox in town. Usually with a parent in tow, both our kids got used to filling holes in the paper rounds from an early age.\r\n\r\nJacquie worked for us in the office off and on during high school and during part of her gap year.\r\n\r\nOur son Rainer also did a stint in the office in his gap year. He has gone on to work on the front line of our troubling juvenile issues and has written for us much quoted think pieces.\r\n\r\nKieran is working on a third book, having just won the Chief Minister&#8217;s NT Book Award for Non-fiction with her Peace Crimes: Pine Gap, national security and dissent.\r\n\r\nI&#8217;ve just turned 77 and well meaning friends are urging me to get a hobby &#8230; stamp collection &#8230; bird watching, that kind of thing.\r\n\r\nNot a chance in the world. While there is a story to be told I want to be there to do it.\r\n\r\nI&#8217;m often asked if I have been a journalist all my life. &#8220;Not yet&#8221; is my answer.\r\n\r\nHow did I start in this profession which, practised ethically, is essential to our democracy, indeed our life?\r\n\r\nThat does not include news media using journalists as advertising salespersons, prostituting our honourable craft.\r\n\r\nI was born and raised in Austria and started at age 16 as an occasional contributor to the Mödlinger Zeitung, serving Mödling, a southern suburb of Vienna.\r\n\r\nI will never forget the buzz I felt when I saw my first by-line in print.\r\n\r\nI studied for a few semesters at the World Trade College and journalism at the Vienna University, but I soon discovered that my chosen job needs to be learned in the streets, not a lecture theatre.\r\n\r\nI joined the Volksblatt, one of up to 11 daily newspapers in Vienna, population about 1.7 million at the time.\r\n\r\nCompetition was ferocious.\r\n\r\nI was doing the police round. Sub judice requirements received little respect. If Hans shot Fritz in the red light Prater district we said so – front page, with all the gory details.\r\n\r\nVienna was a city of newspaper readers, often sitting in upholstered armchairs in coffee shops, which provided a dozen daily papers from Austria and surrounding countries.\r\n\r\nThe Volksblatt newsroom was largely freelance, including me. It&#8217;s a time honoured practice in journalism, lucrative if you&#8217;re any good. I get impatient with the current whinging about contract work.\r\n\r\nI arrived in Australia at age 23, worked at Channel 9 in Adelaide for a year and then as the editor of the West Coast Sentinel in beautiful Streaky Bay for five years.\r\n\r\nMy first story in the NT was Cyclone Tracy on Christmas Day 1974, flying to Darwin with acting Prime Minister Jim Cairns the day after. The aftermath spilled over to Alice Springs with thousands of people travelling south &#8230; stories, stories, stories.\r\n\r\nI was stringing for the national ABC, Seven, Nine and Ten television networks, and some overseas ones.\r\n\r\nI became a glider and light aircraft pilot, learned to ride horses and off-road motorbikes, clocked up 630 skydives and found out how to roll a swag and cook on the campfire, under the stars.\r\n\r\nThey were all things I had been dreaming about as a kid in over-crowded, and often rainy and foggy Austria.\r\n\r\nWork in Alice Springs was rewarding and dramatic. I was first journalist on the scene for the strychnine murder, the balloon disaster, the kamikaze attack on Connair, the Mack truck murders at The Rock and – above all – Azaria.\r\n\r\nThat, in my view, remains a cold case because we still don&#8217;t know who placed the infant&#8217;s clothes on the other side of The Rock.\r\n\r\nMy overseas stories, beginning with the Volksblatt and later for media in Australia, included crossing the Sahara by car for stories about Biafra and the Nigerian civil war at the southern end.\r\n\r\nMy first wife Gail and I were arrested as spies in Biafra but mercifully were released after a day.\r\n\r\nI covered the Cambodian election as seen from the Khmer Rouge stronghold of Siem Reap, flying in Blackhawks with a machine gunner each side and a &#8220;make my day&#8221; look on their faces.\r\n\r\nI was embedded with the Afghan Mujahideen behind Russian lines, together with my son Laurie, then 15 years old.\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85622 aligncenter\" src=\"https://alicespringsnews.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Afghanistan-Laurie-Erwin-660.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"495\" srcset=\"https://alicespringsnews.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Afghanistan-Laurie-Erwin-660.jpg 660w, https://alicespringsnews.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Afghanistan-Laurie-Erwin-660-300x225.jpg 300w, https://alicespringsnews.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Afghanistan-Laurie-Erwin-660-150x113.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" />\r\n\r\nThat was when the Mujahideen were still the good guys, fighting the Russians, and before the US, our government and compliant media threw a switch and declared them to be the bad guys while Osama Bin Laden was living in relative comfort in Pakistan.\r\n\r\nLife as a journo can be a lonely. Some people talk to you because they want you to write a story about them. And some do because they fear you might.\r\n\r\nWhen are you an objective journalist? When both sides of a story hate you equally.\r\n\r\nOne of my early interviews in the NT was in 1977 with then Opposition Leader Jon Isaacs, sitting on a bench in then Todd Street.\r\n\r\nI asked him: Is this on the record?\r\n\r\nHe said: Everything I say to you is on the record.\r\n\r\nThese were the good old days. Now most communications with politicians are via minders, notwithstanding that we journalists are obliged to quote actual sources and not publish hearsay.\r\n\r\nThis must stop and honourable journalists should get together and make sure it does. We can do that: Just report No Comment.\r\n\r\nIn our patch we find MLAs Robyn Lambley, Bill Yan and Chansey Paech readily accessible. Most of their Top End fellow pollies are not.\r\n\r\nThe future of the <em><strong>Alice Springs News</strong></em>?\r\n\r\nThe catastrophic influence of US based social media has truncated the advertising revenue of traditional media the world over.\r\n\r\nSocial media users are willing to trade their privacy for access to Facebook, frequently used for reprehensible purposes. Or they are unaware that&#8217;s what they are doing.\r\n\r\nThe <em><strong>News</strong></em> had to respond to the consequences. It was at times difficult but we forged forward.\r\n\r\nI believe more than ever that we need independent journalism.\r\n\r\nAt the end of last year we made the decision to stop daily reporting but that did not signal the end of my ambitions for the paper, nor for this town where I have now lived most of my life.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that the <em><strong>Alice Springs News</strong></em> will continue to serve and inform our community, and that it will find the support to do this beyond Kieran and – to a point – myself.\r\n\r\nWish us luck!",

We exclude comments only if they are libellous or factually misleading, and advise the writer accordingly. We accept anonymous comments, but require publication of the writer’s name if they are explicitly critical of another named individual not in the public domain (eg a politician). </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">[15] We publish almost all letters to the editor, as long as they have a direct relationship to our circulation area and are not libellous or factually misleading.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Comments and Letters to the Editor</h3>\r\n<p>We greatly appreciate and enjoy the huge feedback we’re getting from our readers. <strong>Please join in.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>There are two ways you can:-</strong></p>\r\n<p>• Use the comment box at the bottom of the “full story” page. For this you can quote a pseudonym or a pen name, although we strongly urge you to supply your full name for publication: This will enhance greatly the importance the readers will attribute to your comment.</p>\r\n<p>• We will not permit personal attacks from a position of anonymity. If you are attacking a private person, you need to provide, for publication, your name and town or city of residence, plus a phone number for verification purposes. We will not publish your email address nor your phone number.</p>\r\n<p>• We extend the privilege of anonymity to readers attacking people who put themselves into the public arena as elected members, politicians or spokespeople, but the comments need to be restricted to the field in which those “public” people are operating. Comments need to be civilised and not include excessively crude language.</p>\r\n<p>• Playing the ball rather than the person advances the conversation and better helps to further explore issues.</p>\r\n<p>• Email us a Letter to the Editor. For this we require, for publication, your name and town or city of residence, plus a phone number for verification purposes. This form of making your point is <strong>far more</strong> credible and effective than making a comment anonymously.</p>\r\n<p>• We accept, with regret, that some corporations and public service institutions will seek to silence and even victimise people who speak out.
